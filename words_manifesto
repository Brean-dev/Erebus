increased

thus
rescued
a

from
the
idiocy
of

just
as
it

slumbered

of

we
see
then
the
means
of
production
and
of

on
whose
foundation
the
bourgeoisie
built
itself
up
were
generated
in
feudal
society
at
a
certain
stage
in
the
development
of
these
means
of
production
and
of

the

under
which
feudal
society
produced
and
exchanged
the
feudal
organisation
of
agriculture
and
manufacturing
industry
in
one
word
the
feudal
relations
of
property
became
no
longer
compatible
with
the
already
developed

they
became
so

they
had
to

a

is
going
on
before
our
own

modern

with
its

of

and
of

a
society
that
has
conjured
up
such
gigantic

of

and

is
like
the

is
no

has
called
up
by

the

is
but
the
history
of
the
revolt
of
modern
productive

against
modern

of

against
the
property
relations
that
are
the
conditions
for
the
existence
of
the
bourgeois
and
of
its
rule
it
is
enough
to
mention
the
commercial
crises
that
by
their
periodical
return
put
the
existence
of
the
entire
bourgeois
society
on
its
trial
each
time
more
threateningly
in
these
crises
a
great
part
not
only
of
the
existing
products
but
also
of
the
previously
created
productive
forces
are
periodically
destroyed
in
these
crises
there
breaks
out
an
epidemic
that
in
all
earlier
epochs
would
have
seemed
an
absurdity
the
epidemic
of
overproduction
society
suddenly
finds
itself
put
back
into
a
state
of
momentary
barbarism
it
appears
as
if
a
famine
a
universal
war
of
devastation
had
cut
off
the
supply
of
every
means
of
subsistence
industry
and
commerce
seem
to
be
destroyed
and
why
because
there
is
too
much
civilisation
too
much
means
of
subsistence
too
much
industry
too
much
commerce
the
productive
forces
at
the
disposal
of
society
no
longer
tend
to
further
the
development
of
the
conditions
of
bourgeois
property
on
the
contrary
they
have
become
too
powerful
for
these
conditions
by
which
they
are
fettered
and
so
soon
as
they
overcome
these
fetters
they
bring
disorder
into
the
whole
of
bourgeois
society
endanger
the
existence
of
bourgeois
property
the
conditions
of
bourgeois
society
are
too
narrow
to
comprise
the
wealth
created
by
them
and
how
does
the
bourgeoisie
get
over
these
crises
on
the
one
hand
by
enforced
destruction
of
a
mass
of
productive
forces
on
the
other
by
the
conquest
of
new
markets
and
by
the
more
thorough
exploitation
of
the
old
ones
that
is
to
say
by
paving
the
way
for
more
extensive
and
more
destructive
crises
and
by
diminishing
the
means
whereby
crises
are
prevented
manifesto
of
the
communist
party
the
weapons
with
which
the
bourgeoisie
felled
feudalism
to
the
ground
are
now
turned
against
the
bourgeoisie
itself
but
not
only
has
the
bourgeoisie
forged
the
weapons
that
bring
death
to
itself
it
has
also
called
into

only
so

increases
capital
these
labourers
who
must
sell
themselves
piecemeal
are
a
commodity
like
every
other
article
of
commerce
and
are
consequently
exposed
to
all
the
vicissitudes
of
competition
to
all
the
fluctuations
of
the
market
owing
to
the
extensive
use
of
machinery
and
to
the
division
of
labour
the
work
of
the
proletarians
has
lost
all
individual
character
and
consequently
all
charm
for
the
workman
he
becomes
an
appendage
of
the
machine
and
it
is
only
the
most
simple
most
monotonous
and
most
easily
acquired
knack
that
is
required
of
him
hence
the
cost
of
production
of
a
workman
is
restricted
almost
entirely
to
the
means
of
subsistence
that
he
requires
for
maintenance
and
for
the
propagation
of
his
race
but
the
price
of
a
commodity
and
therefore
also
of
labour
is
equal
to
its
cost
of
production
in
proportion
therefore
as
the
repulsiveness
of
the
work
increases
the
wage
decreases
nay
more
in
proportion
as
the
use
of
machinery
and
division
of
labour
increases
in
the
same
proportion
the
burden
of
toil
also
increases
whether
by
prolongation
of

by
the
increase
of
the

exacted
in

by

the

generally
the

all
these
sink
gradually
into

because
their

does
not
suffice
for
the
scale
on
which
modern
industry
is
carried
on
and
is
swamped
in
the
competition
with
the
large
capitalists
partly
because
their
specialised
skill
is
rendered
worthless
by
new
methods
of

thus
the
proletariat
is
recruited
from
all
classes
of
the
population
the
proletariat
goes
through
various
stages
of
development
with
its
birth
begins
its
struggle
with
the
bourgeoisie
at
first
the
contest
is
carried
on
by
individual
labourers
then
by
the
workpeople
of
a
factory
then
by
the
operative
of
one
trade
in
one
locality
against
the
individual
bourgeois
who
directly
exploits
them
they
direct
their
attacks
not
against
the
bourgeois
conditions
of
production
but
against
the
instruments
of
production
themselves
they
destroy
imported
wares
that
compete
with
their
labour
they
smash
to
pieces
machinery
they
set
factories
ablaze
they
seek
to
restore
by
force
the
vanished
status
of
the
workman
of
the
middle
ages
manifesto
of
the
communist
party
at
this
stage
the
labourers
still
form
an
incoherent
mass
scattered
over
the
whole
country
and
broken
up
by
their
mutual
competition
if
anywhere
they
unite
to
form
more
compact
bodies
this
is
not
yet
the
consequence
of
their
own
active
union
but
of
the
union
of
the
bourgeoisie
which
class
in
order
to
attain
its
own
political
ends
is
compelled
to
set
the
whole
proletariat
in
motion
and
is
moreover
yet
for
a
time
able
to
do
so
at
this
stage
therefore
the
proletarians
do
not
fight
their
enemies
but
the
enemies
of
their
enemies
the
remnants
of
absolute
monarchy
the
landowners
the
non
industrial
bourgeois
the
petty
bourgeois
thus
the
whole
historical
movement
is
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
the
bourgeoisie
every
victory
so
obtained
is
a
victory
for
the
bourgeoisie
but
with
the
development
of
industry
the
proletariat
not
only
increases
in
number
it
becomes
concentrated
in
greater
masses
its
strength
grows
and
it
feels
that
strength
more
the
various
interests
and
conditions
of
life
within
the
ranks
of
the
proletariat
are
more
and
more
equalised
in
proportion
as
machinery
obliterates
all
distinctions
of
labour
and
nearly
everywhere
reduces
wages
to
the
same
low
level
the
growing
competition
among
the
bourgeois
and
the
resulting
commercial
crises
make
the
wages
of
the
workers
ever
more
fluctuating
the
increasing
improvement
of
machinery
ever
more
rapidly
developing
makes
their
livelihood
more
and
more
precarious
the
collisions
between
individual
workmen
and
individual
bourgeois
take
more
and
more
the
character
of
collisions
between
two
classes
thereupon
the
workers
begin
to
form
combinations
trades
unions
against
the
bourgeois
they
club
together
in
order
to
keep
up
the
rate
of
wages
they
found
permanent
associations
in
order
to
make
provision
beforehand
for
these
occasional
revolts
here
and
there
the
contest
breaks
out
into
riots
now
and
then
the
workers
are
victorious
but
only
for
a
time
the
real
fruit
of
their
battles
lies
not
in
the
immediate
result
but
in
the
ever
expanding
union
of
the
workers
this
union
is
helped
on
by
the
improved
means
of
communication
that
are
created
by
modern
industry
and
that
place
the
workers
of
different
localities
in
contact
with
one
another
it
was
just
this
contact
that
was
needed
to
centralise
the
numerous
local
struggles
all
of
the
same
character
into
one
national
struggle
between
classes
but
every
class
struggle
is
a
political
struggle
and
that
union
to
attain
which
the
burghers
of
the
middle
ages
with
their
miserable
highways
required
centuries
the
modern
proletarian
thanks
to
railways
achieve
in
a
few
years
this
organisation
of
the
proletarians
into
a
class
and
consequently
into
a
political
party
is
continually
being
upset
again
by
the
competition
between
the
workers
themselves
but
it
ever
rises
up
again
stronger
firmer
mightier
it
compels
legislative
recognition
of
particular
interests
of
the
workers
by
taking
advantage
of
the
divisions
among
the
bourgeoisie
itself
thus
the
tenhours
bill
in
england
was
carried
altogether
collisions
between
the
classes
of
the
old
society
further
in
many
ways
the
course
of
development
of
the
proletariat
the
bourgeoisie
finds
itself
involved
in
a
constant
battle
at
first
with
the
aristocracy
later
on
with
those
portions
of
the
bourgeoisie
itself
whose
interests
have
become
antagonistic
to
the
progress
of
industry
at
all
time
with
the
bourgeoisie
of
foreign
countries
in
all
these
battles
it
sees
itself
compelled
to
appeal
to
the
proletariat
to
ask
for
help
and
thus
to
drag
it
into
the
political
arena
the
bourgeoisie
itself
therefore
supplies
the
proletariat
with
its
own
elements
of
political
and
general
education
in
other
words
it
furnishes
the
proletariat
with
weapons
for
fighting
the
bourgeoisie
further
as
we
have
already
seen
entire
sections
of
the
ruling
class
are
by
the
advance
of
industry
precipitated
into
the
proletariat
or
are
at
least
threatened
in
their
conditions
of
existence
these
also
supply
the
proletariat
with
fresh
elements
of
enlightenment
and
progress
finally
in
times
when
the
class
struggle
nears
the
decisive
hour
the
progress
of
dissolution
going
on
within
the
ruling
class
in
fact
within
the
whole
range
of
old
society
assumes
such
a
violent
glaring
character
that
a
small
section
of
the
ruling
class
cuts
itself
adrift
and
joins
the
revolutionary
class
the
class
that
holds
the
future
in
its
hands
just
as
therefore
at
an
earlier
manifesto
of
the
communist
party
period
a
section
of
the
nobility
went
over
to
the
bourgeoisie
so
now
a
portion
of
the
bourgeoisie
goes
over
to
the
proletariat
and
in
particular
a
portion
of
the
bourgeois
ideologists
who
have
raised
themselves
to
the
level
of
comprehending
theoretically
the
historical
movement
as
a
whole
of
all
the
classes
that
stand
face
to
face
with
the
bourgeoisie
today
the
proletariat
alone
is
a
really
revolutionary
class
the
other
classes
decay
and
finally
disappear
in
the
face
of
modern
industry
the
proletariat
is
its
special
and
essential
product
the
lower
middle
class
the
small
manufacturer
the
shopkeeper
the
artisan
the
peasant
all
these
fight
against
the
bourgeoisie
to
save
from
extinction
their
existence
as
fractions
of
the
middle
class
they
are
therefore
not
revolutionary
but
conservative
nay
more
they
are
reactionary
for
they
try
to
roll
back
the
wheel
of
history
if
by
chance
they
are
revolutionary
they
are
only
so
in
view
of
their
impending
transfer
into
the
proletariat
they
thus
defend
not
their
present
but
their
future
interests
they
desert
their
own
standpoint
to
place
themselves
at
that
of
the
proletariat
the
dangerous
class
lumpenproletariat
the
social
scum
that
passively
rotting
mass
thrown
off
by
the
lowest
layers
of
the
old
society
may
here
and
there
be
swept
into
the
movement
by
a
proletarian
revolution
its
conditions
of
life
however
prepare
it
far
more
for
the
part
of
a
bribed
tool
of
reactionary
intrigue
in
the
condition
of
the
proletariat
those
of
old
society
at
large
are
already
virtually
swamped
the
proletarian
is
without
property
his
relation
to
his
wife
and
children
has
no
longer
anything
in
common
with
the
bourgeois
family
relations
modern
industry
labour
modern
subjection
to
capital
the
same
in
england
as
in
france
in
america
as
in
germany
has
stripped
him
of
every
trace
of
national
character
law
morality
religion
are
to
him
so
many
bourgeois
prejudices
behind
which
lurk
in
ambush
just
as
many
bourgeois
interests
all
the
preceding
classes
that
got
the
upper
hand
sought
to
fortify
their
already
acquired
status
by
subjecting
society
at
large
to
their
conditions
of
appropriation
the
proletarians
cannot
become
masters
of
the
productive
forces
of
society
except
by
abolishing
their
own
previous
mode
of
appropriation
and
thereby
also
every
other
previous
mode
of
appropriation
they
have
nothing
of
their
own
to
secure
and
to
fortify
their
mission
is
to
destroy
all
previous
securities
for
and
insurances
of
individual
property
all
previous
historical
movements
were
movements
of
minorities
or
in
the
interest
of
minorities
the
proletarian
movement
is
the
self
conscious
independent
movement
of
the
immense
majority
in
the
interest
of
the
immense
majority
the
proletariat
the
lowest
stratum
of
our
present
society
cannot
stir
cannot
raise
itself
up
without
the
whole
superincumbent
strata
of
official
society
being
sprung
into
the
air
though
not
in
substance
yet
in
form
the
struggle
of
the
proletariat
with
the
bourgeoisie
is
at
first
a
national
struggle
the
proletariat
of
each
country
must
of
course
first
of
all
settle
matters
with
its
own
bourgeoisie
in
depicting
the
most
general
phases
of
the
development
of
the
proletariat
we
traced
the
more
or
less
veiled
civil
war
raging
within
existing
society
up
to
the
point
where
that
war
breaks
out
into
open
revolution
and
where
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
bourgeoisie
lays
the
foundation
for
the
sway
of
the
proletariat
hitherto
every
form
of
society
has
been
based
as
we
have
already
seen
on
the
antagonism
of
oppressing
and
oppressed
classes
but
in
order
to
oppress
a
class
certain
conditions
must
be
assured
to
it
under
which
it
can
at
least
continue
its
slavish
existence
the
serf
in
the
period
of
serfdom
raised
himself
to
membership
in
the
commune
just
as
the
petty
bourgeois
under
the
yoke
of
the
feudal
absolutism
managed
to
develop
into
a
bourgeois
the
modern
labourer
on
the
contrary
instead
of
rising
with
the
process
of
industry
sinks
deeper
and
deeper
below
the
conditions
of
existence
of
his
own
class
he
becomes
a
pauper
and
pauperism
develops
more
rapidly
than
population
and
wealth
and
here
it
becomes
evident
that
the
bourgeoisie
is
unfit
any
longer
to
be
the
ruling
class
in
society
and
to
impose
its
conditions
of
existence
upon
society
as
manifesto
of
the
communist
party
an
over
riding
law
it
is
unfit
to
rule
because
it
is
incompetent
to
assure
an
existence
to
its
slave
within
his
slavery
because
it
cannot
help
letting
him
sink
into
such
a
state
that
it
has
to
feed
him
instead
of
being
fed
by
him
society
can
no
longer
live
under
this
bourgeoisie
in
other
words
its
existence
is
no
longer
compatible
with
society
the
essential
conditions
for
the
existence
and
for
the
sway
of
the
bourgeois
class
is
the
formation
and
augmentation
of
capital
the
condition
for
capital
is
wage
labour
wage
labour
rests
exclusively
on
competition
between
the
labourers
the
advance
of
industry
whose
involuntary
promoter
is
the
bourgeoisie
replaces
the
isolation
of
the
labourers
due
to
competition
by
the
revolutionary
combination
due
to
association
the
development
of
modern
industry
therefore
cuts
from
under
its
feet
the
very
foundation
on
which
the
bourgeoisie
produces
and
appropriates
products
what
the
bourgeoisie
therefore
produces
above
all
are
its
own
grave
diggers
its
fall
and
the
victory
of
the
proletariat
are
equally
inevitable
ii
proletarians
and
communists
in
what
relation
do
the
communists
stand
to
the
proletarians
as
a
whole
the
communists
do
not
form
a
separate
party
opposed
to
the
other
working
class
parties
they
have
no
interests
separate
and
apart
from
those
of
the
proletariat
as
a
whole
they
do
not
set
up
any
sectarian
principles
of
their
own
by
which
to
shape
and
mould
the
proletarian
movement
the
communists
are
distinguished
from
the
other
working
class
parties
by
this
only
in
the
national
struggles
of
the
proletarians
of
the
different
countries
they
point
out
and
bring
to
the
front
the
common
interests
of
the
entire
proletariat
independently
of
all
nationality
in
the
various
stages
of
development
which
the
struggle
of
the
working
class
against
the
bourgeoisie
has
to
pass
through
they
always
and
everywhere
represent
the
interests
of
the
movement
as
a
whole
the
communists
therefore
are
on
the
one
hand
practically
the
most
advanced
and
resolute
section
of
the
working
class
parties
of
every
country
that
section
which
pushes
forward
all
others
on
the
other
hand
theoretically
they
have
over
the
great
mass
of
the
proletariat
the
advantage
of
clearly
understanding
the
line
of
march
the
conditions
and
the
ultimate
general
results
of
the
proletarian
movement
the
immediate
aim
of
the
communists
is
the
same
as
that
of
all
other
proletarian
parties
formation
of
the
proletariat
into
a
class
overthrow
of
the
bourgeois
supremacy
conquest
of
political
power
by
the
proletariat
the
theoretical
conclusions
of
the
communists
are
in
no
way
based
on
ideas
or
principles
that
have
been
invented
or
discovered
by
this
or
that
would
be
universal
reformer
they
merely
express
in
general
terms
actual
relations
springing
from
an
existing
class
struggle
from
a
historical
movement
going
on
under
our
very
eyes
the
abolition
of
existing
property
relations
is
not
at
all
a
distinctive
feature
of
communism
all
property
relations
in
the
past
have
continually
been
subject
to
historical
change
consequent
upon
the
change
in
historical
conditions
the
french
revolution
for
example
abolished
feudal
property
in
favour
of
bourgeois
property
the
distinguishing
feature
of
communism
is
not
the
abolition
of
property
generally
but
the
abolition
of
bourgeois
property
but
modern
bourgeois
private
property
is
the
final
and
most
complete
expression
of
the
system
of
producing
and
appropriating
products
that
is
based
on
class
antagonisms
on
the
exploitation
of
the
many
by
the
few
in
this
sense
the
theory
of
the
communists
may
be
summed
up
in
the
single
sentence
abolition
of
private
property
we
communists
have
been
reproached
with
the
desire
of
abolishing
the
right
of
personally
acquiring
property
as
the
fruit
of
a
man
s
own
labour
which
property
is
alleged
to
be
the
groundwork
of
all
personal
freedom
activity
and
independence
hard
won
self
acquired
self
earned
property
do
you
mean
the
property
of
petty
artisan
and
of
the
small
peasant
a
form
of
property
that
preceded
the
bourgeois
form
there
is
no
need
to
abolish
that
the
development
of
industry
has
to
a
great
extent
already
destroyed
it
and
is
still
destroying
it
daily
or
do
you
mean
the
modern
bourgeois
private
property
but
does
wage
labour
create
any
property
for
the
labourer
not
a
bit
it
creates
capital
i
e
that
kind
of
property
which
exploits
wage
labour
and
which
cannot
increase
except
upon
condition
of
begetting
a
new
supply
of
wage
labour
for
fresh
exploitation
property
in
its
present
form
is
chapter
ii
proletarians
and
communists
based
on
the
antagonism
of
capital
and
wage
labour
let
us
examine
both
sides
of
this
antagonism
to
be
a
capitalist
is
to
have
not
only
a
purely
personal
but
a
social
status
in
production
capital
is
a
collective
product
and
only
by
the
united
action
of
many
members
nay
in
the
last
resort
only
by
the
united
action
of
all
members
of
society
can
it
be
set
in
motion
capital
is
therefore
not
only
personal
it
is
a
social
power
when
therefore
capital
is
converted
into
common
property
into
the
property
of
all
members
of
society
personal
property
is
not
thereby
transformed
into
social
property
it
is
only
the
social
character
of
the
property
that
is
changed
it
loses
its
class
character
let
us
now
take
wage
labour
the
average
price
of
wage
labour
is
the
minimum
wage
i
e
that
quantum
of
the
means
of
subsistence
which
is
absolutely
requisite
to
keep
the
labourer
in
bare
existence
as
a
labourer
what
therefore
the
wage
labourer
appropriates
by
means
of
his
labour
merely
suffices
to
prolong
and
reproduce
a
bare
existence
we
by
no
means
intend
to
abolish
this
personal
appropriation
of
the
products
of
labour
an
appropriation
that
is
made
for
the
maintenance
and
reproduction
of
human
life
and
that
leaves
no
surplus
wherewith
to
command
the
labour
of
others
all
that
we
want
to
do
away
with
is
the
miserable
character
of
this
appropriation
under
which
the
labourer
lives
merely
to
increase
capital
and
is
allowed
to
live
only
in
so
far
as
the
interest
of
the
ruling
class
requires
it
in
bourgeois
society
living
labour
is
but
a
means
to
increase
accumulated
labour
in
communist
society
accumulated
labour
is
but
a
means
to
widen
to
enrich
to
promote
the
existence
of
the
labourer
in
bourgeois
society
therefore
the
past
dominates
the
present
in
communist
society
the
present
dominates
the
past
in
bourgeois
society
capital
is
independent
and
has
individuality
while
the
living
person
is
dependent
and
has
no
individuality
and
the
abolition
of
this
state
of
things
is
called
by
the
bourgeois
abolition
of
individuality
and
freedom
and
rightly
so
the
abolition
of
bourgeois
individuality
bourgeois
independence
and
bourgeois
freedom
is
undoubtedly
aimed
at
by
freedom
is
meant
under
the
present
bourgeois
conditions
of
production
free
trade
free
selling
and
buying
but
if
selling
and
buying
disappears
free
selling
and
buying
disappears
also
this
talk
about
free
selling
and
buying
and
all
the
other
brave
words
of
our
bourgeois
about
freedom
in
general
have
a
meaning
if
any
only
in
contrast
with
restricted
selling
and
buying
with
the
fettered
traders
of
the
middle
ages
but
have
no
meaning
when
opposed
to
the
communistic
abolition
of
buying
and
selling
of
the
bourgeois
conditions
of
production
and
of
the
bourgeoisie
itself
you
are
horrified
at
our
intending
to
do
away
with
private
property
but
in
your
existing
society
private
property
is
already
done
away
with
for
nine
tenths
of
the
population
its
existence
for
the
few
is
solely
due
to
its
non
existence
in
the
hands
of
those
nine
tenths
you
reproach
us
therefore
with
intending
to
do
away
with
a
form
of
property
the
necessary
condition
for
whose
existence
is
the
non
existence
of
any
property
for
the
immense
majority
of
society
in
one
word
you
reproach
us
with
intending
to
do
away
with
your
property
precisely
so
that
is
just
what
we
intend
from
the
moment
when
labour
can
no
longer
be
converted
into
capital
money
or
rent
into
a
social
power
capable
of
being
monopolised
i
e
from
the
moment
when
individual
property
can
no
longer
be
transformed
into
bourgeois
property
into
capital
from
that
moment
you
say
individuality
vanishes
chapter
ii
proletarians
and
communists
you
must
therefore
confess
that
by
individual
you
mean
no
other
person
than
the
bourgeois
than
the
middle
class
owner
of
property
this
person
must
indeed
be
swept
out
of
the
way
and
made
impossible
communism
deprives
no
man
of
the
power
to
appropriate
the
products
of
society
all
that
it
does
is
to
deprive
him
of
the
power
to
subjugate
the
labour
of
others
by
means
of
such
appropriations
it
has
been
objected
that
upon
the
abolition
of
private
property
all
work
will
cease
and
universal
laziness
will
overtake
us
according
to
this
bourgeois
society
ought
long
ago
to
have
gone
to
the
dogs
through
sheer
idleness
for
those
of
its
members
who
work
acquire
nothing
and
those
who
acquire
anything
do
not
work
the
whole
of
this
objection
is
but
another
expression
of
the
tautology
that
there
can
no
longer
be
any
wage
labour
when
there
is
no
longer
any
capital
all
objections
urged
against
the
communistic
mode
of
producing
and
appropriating
material
products
have
in
the
same
way
been
urged
against
the
communistic
mode
of
producing
and
appropriating
intellectual
products
just
as
to
the
bourgeois
the
disappearance
of
class
property
is
the
disappearance
of
production
itself
so
the
disappearance
of
class
culture
is
to
him
identical
with
the
disappearance
of
all
culture
that
culture
the
loss
of
which
he
laments
is
for
the
enormous
majority
a
mere
training
to
act
as
a
machine
but
don
t
wrangle
with
us
so
long
as
you
apply
to
our
intended
abolition
of
bourgeois
property
the
standard
of
your
bourgeois
notions
of
freedom
culture
law
c
your
very
ideas
are
but
the
outgrowth
of
the
conditions
of
your
bourgeois
production
and
bourgeois
property
just
as
your
jurisprudence
is
but
the
will
of
your
class
made
into
a
law
for
all
a
will
whose
essential
character
and
direction
are
determined
by
the
economical
conditions
of
existence
of
your
class
the
selfish
misconception
that
induces
you
to
transform
into
eternal
laws
of
nature
and
of
reason
the
social
forms
springing
from
your
present
mode
of
production
and
form
of
property
historical
relations
that
rise
and
disappear
in
the
progress
of
production
this
misconception
you
share
with
every
ruling
class
that
has
preceded
you
what
you
see
clearly
in
the
case
of
ancient
property
what
you
admit
in
the
case
of
feudal
property
you
are
of
course
forbidden
to
admit
in
the
case
of
your
own
bourgeois
form
of
property
abolition
aufhebung
of
the
family
even
the
most
radical
flare
up
at
this
infamous
proposal
of
the
communists
on
what
foundation
is
the
present
family
the
bourgeois
family
based
on
capital
on
private
gain
in
its
completely
developed
form
this
family
exists
only
among
the
bourgeoisie
but
this
state
of
things
finds
its
complement
in
the
practical
absence
of
the
family
among
the
proletarians
and
in
public
prostitution
the
bourgeois
family
will
vanish
as
a
matter
of
course
when
its
complement
vanishes
and
both
will
vanish
with
the
vanishing
of
capital
do

we
plead
guilty
but
you
say
we
destroy
the

we
replace

by

you
educate

have
not
invented
the

they
do

screams
the

in

the
bourgeois
sees
his
wife
a
mere
instrument
of

he
hears
that
the
instruments
of

are
to
be
exploited
in
common
and
naturally
can
come
to
no
other
conclusion
that
the
lot
of
being
common
to
all
will
likewise
fall
to
the
women
he
has
not
even
a
suspicion
that
the
real
point
aimed
at
is
to
do
away
with
the
status
of

as
mere
instruments

for
the

nothing
is
more
ridiculous
than
the
virtuous
indignation
of
our
bourgeois
at
the
community
of
women
which
they
pretend
is
to
be
openly
and
officially
established
by
the

the
communists
have
no
need
to
introduce
community
of

it
has
existed
almost
from
time
immemorial
our
bourgeois
not
content
with
having
wives
and
daughters
of
their
proletarians
at
their
disposal
not
to
speak
of
common
prostitutes
take
the
greatest
pleasure
in
seducing
each
other
s
wives
bourgeois
marriage
is
in
reality
a
system
of
wives
in
common
and
thus
at
the
most
what
the
communists
might
possibly
be
reproached
with
is
that
they
desire
to
introduce
in
substitution
for
a
hypocritically
concealed
an
openly
legalised
community
of
women
for
the
rest
it
is
selfevident
that
the
abolition
of
the
present
system
of
production
must
bring
with
it
the
abolition
of
the
community
of
women
springing
from
that
system
i
e
of
prostitution
both
public
and
private
the
communists
are
further
reproached
with
desiring
to
abolish
countries

the

have
no
country
we
cannot
take
from
them
what
they
have

first
of

not

national

are

to

within

undoubtedly
it

be

there
are

eternal

such
as

that
are

to

abolishes
eternal

it
abolishes

instead
of
constituting

on

it
therefore
acts
in

to
all

experience
what
does
this
accusation
reduce
itself
to
the
history
of

past
society
has
consisted
in

have
taken
one
fact
is
common
to
all
past

viz
the
exploitation

of

by
the
other
no
wonder
then
that
the
social
consciousness
of
past
ages
despite
all
the
multiplicity
and
variety
it
displays
moves
within
certain
common
forms
or
general
ideas
which
cannot
completely
vanish

with
the
total
disappearance
of

the

is
the
most
radical
rupture
with

relations
no
wonder
that
its
development
involved
the
most
radical
rupture
with
traditional
ideas
but
let
us
have
done
with
the
bourgeois
objections
to
communism
we
have
seen
above
that
the
first
step
in
the
revolution
by
the
working
class
is
to
raise
the
proletariat
to
the
position
of
ruling
class
to
win
the
battle
of
democracy
the
proletariat
will
use
its
political
supremacy
to
wrest
by
degree
all
capital
from
the
bourgeoisie
to
centralise
all
instruments
of
production
in
the

organised
as

and
to
increase
the
total
productive
forces
as
rapidly
as
possible
of
course
in
the
beginning
this
cannot
be
effected
except
by
means
of
despotic
inroads
on
the
rights
of
property
and
on
the
conditions
of
bourgeois
production
by
means
of
measures
therefore
which
appear
economically
insufficient
and
untenable
but
which
in
the
course
of
the
movement
outstrip
themselves
necessitate
further
inroads
upon
the
old
social
order
and
are
unavoidable
as
a
means
of
entirely
revolutionising
the
mode
of

these
measures
will
of

be
different
in

in

will
be

a
feudal
socialism
owing
to
their
historical
position
it
became
the
vocation
of
the
aristocracies
of
france
and
england
to
write
pamphlets
against
modern
bourgeois
society
in
the
french
revolution
of
july
and
in
the
english
reform
agitation
these
aristocracies
again
succumbed
to
the
hateful
upstart
thenceforth
a
serious
political
struggle
was
altogether
out
of
the
question
a
literary
battle
alone
remained
possible
but
even
in
the
domain
of
literature
the
old
cries
of
the
restoration
period
had
become
impossible
in
order
to
arouse
sympathy
the
aristocracy
was
obliged
to
lose
sight
apparently
of
its
own
interests
and
to
formulate
their
indictment
against
the
bourgeoisie
in
the
interest
of
the
exploited
working
class
alone
thus
the
aristocracy
took
their
revenge
by
singing
lampoons
on
their
new
masters
and
whispering
in
his
ears
sinister
prophesies
of
coming
catastrophe

arose

half
lamentation

half
an

its
bitter
witty
and
incisive
criticism
striking
the

to
the
very
heart
s
core
but
always
ludicrous
in
its
effect
through
total
incapacity
to
comprehend
the
march
of
modern

the
aristocracy
in
order
to
rally
the
people

them
waved
the
proletarian
alms
bag
in
front
for
a
banner
but
the
people
so
often
as
it
joined
them
saw
on
their
hindquarters
the
old
feudal
coats
of
arms
and
deserted
with
loud
and
irreverent
laughter
one
section
of
the
french
legitimists
and
young
england
exhibited
this
spectacle
in
pointing
out
that
their
mode
of
exploitation
was
different
to
that
of
the
bourgeoisie
the
feudalists
forget
that
they
exploited
under
circumstances
and
conditions
that
were
quite
different
and
that
are
now
antiquated
in
showing
that
under
their
rule
the
modern
proletariat
never
existed
they
forget
that
the
modern
bourgeoisie
is
the
necessary
offspring
of
their
own
form
of
society
for
the
rest
so
little
do
they
conceal
the
reactionary
character
of
their
criticism
that
their
chief
accusation
against
the
bourgeois
amounts
to
this
that
under
the
bourgeois
r
gime
a
class
is
being
developed
which
is
destined
to
cut
up
root
and
branch
the
old
order
of
society
what
they
upbraid
the
bourgeoisie
with
is
not
so
much
that
it
creates
a
proletariat
as
that
it
creates
a
revolutionary
proletariat
in
political
practice
therefore
they
join
in
all
coercive
measures
against
the
working
class
and
in
ordinary
life
despite
their
high
falutin
phrases
they
stoop
to
pick
up
the
golden
apples
dropped
from
the
tree
of

and
to
barter

for

the

was
not
the

class
that
was
ruined
by
the
bourgeoisie
not
the
only
class
whose
conditions
of
existence
pined
and
perished
in
the
atmosphere
of
modern
bourgeois
society
the
medieval
burgesses
and
the
small
peasant
proprietors
were
the
precursors
of
the
modern
bourgeoisie
in
those
countries
which
are
but
little
developed
industrially
and
commercially
these
two
classes
still
vegetate
side
by
side
with
the
rising
bourgeoisie
in
countries
where
modern
civilisation
has
become
fully
developed
a
new
class
of
petty
bourgeois
has
been
formed
fluctuating
between
proletariat
and
bourgeoisie
and
ever
renewing
itself
as
a
supplementary
part
of
bourgeois
society
the
individual
members
of
this
class
however
are
being
constantly
hurled
down
into
the
proletariat
by
the
action
of
competition
and
as
modern
industry
develops
they
even
see
the
moment
approaching
when
they
will
completely
disappear
as
an
independent
section
of
modern
society
to
be
replaced
in
manufactures
agriculture
and
commerce
by
overlookers
bailiffs
and
shopmen
in
countries
like
france
where
the
peasants
constitute
far
more
than
half
of
the
population
it
was
natural
that
writers
who
sided
with
the
proletariat
against
the
bourgeoisie
should
use
in
their
criticism
of
the
bourgeois
r
gime
the
standard
of
the
peasant
and
petty
bourgeois
and
from
the
standpoint
of
these
intermediate
classes
should
take
up
the
cudgels
for
the
working
class
thus
arose
petty
bourgeois
socialism
sismondi
was
the
head
of
this
school
not
only
in
france
but
also
in
england
this
school
of
socialism
dissected
with
great
acuteness
the
contradictions
in
the
conditions
of
modern
production
it
laid
bare
the
hypocritical
apologies
of
economists
it
proved
incontrovertibly
the
disastrous
effects
of
machinery
and
division
of
labour
the
concentration
of
capital
and
land
in
a
few
hands
overproduction
and

it
pointed
out
the
inevitable
ruin
of
the
petty

and

misery
of
the

the
anarchy
in

the
crying
inequalities
in

between

the
dissolution
of

moral
bonds
of
the
old

relations
of
the
old
nationalities
in
its
positive
aims
however
this
form
of
socialism
aspires
either
to
restoring
the
old
means
of
production
and
of
exchange
and
with
them
the
old
property
relations
and
the
old
society
or
to
cramping
the
modern
means
of
production
and
of
exchange
within
the
framework
of
the
old
property
relations
that
have
been
and
were
bound
to
be
exploded
by
those

in
either

it
is
both
reactionary

ultimately
when

literature
social
conditions
this
french
literature
lost
all
its
immediate
practical
significance
and
assumed
a
purely
literary
aspect
thus
to
the
german
philosophers
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
demands
of
the
first
french
revolution
were
nothing
more
than
the
demands
of
practical
reason
in
general
and
the
utterance
of
the
will
of
the
revolutionary
french
bourgeoisie
signified
in
their
eyes
the
laws
of
pure
will
of
will
as
it
was
bound
to
be
of
true
human
will
generally
the
work
of
the
german
literati
consisted
solely
in
bringing
the
new
french
ideas
into
harmony
with
their
ancient
philosophical
conscience
or
rather
in
annexing
the
french
ideas
without
deserting
their
own
philosophic
point
of
view
this
annexation
took
place
in
the
same
way
in
which
a
foreign
language
is
appropriated
namely
by
translation
it
is
well
known
how
the
monks
wrote
silly
lives
of
catholic
saints
over
the
manuscripts
on
which
the
classical
works
of
ancient
heathendom
had
been
written
the
german
literati
reversed
this
process
with
the
profane
french
literature
they
wrote
their
philosophical
nonsense
beneath
the
french
original
for
instance
beneath
the
french
criticism
of
the
economic
functions
of
money
they
wrote
alienation
of
humanity
and
beneath
the
french
criticism
of
the
bourgeois
state
they
wrote
dethronement
of
the
category
of
the
general
and
so
forth
the
introduction
of
these
philosophical
phrases
at
the
back
of
the
french
historical
criticisms
they
dubbed
philosophy
of
action
true
socialism
german
science
of
socialism
philosophical
foundation
of
socialism
and
so
on
the
french
socialist
and
communist
literature
was
thus
completely
emasculated
and
since
it
ceased
in
the
hands
of
the
german
to
express
the
struggle
of
one
class
with
the
other
he
felt
conscious
of
having
overcome
french
one
sidedness
and
of
representing
not
true
requirements
but
the
requirements
of
truth
not
the
interests
of
the
proletariat
but
the
interests
of
human
nature
of
man
in
general
who
belongs
to
no
class
has
no
reality
who
exists
only
in
the
misty
realm
of
philosophical
fantasy
this
german
socialism
which
took
its
schoolboy
task
so
seriously
and
solemnly
and
extolled
its
poor
stock
in
trade
in
such
a
mountebank
fashion
meanwhile
gradually
lost
its
pedantic
innocence
the
fight
of
the
germans
and
especially
of
the
prussian
bourgeoisie
against
feudal
aristocracy
and
absolute
monarchy
in
other
words
the
liberal
movement
became
more
earnest
by
this
the
long
wished
for
opportunity
was
offered
to
true
socialism
of
confronting
the
political
movement
with
the
socialist
demands
of
hurling
the
traditional
anathemas
against
liberalism
against
representative
government
against
bourgeois
competition
bourgeois
freedom
of
the
press
bourgeois
legislation
bourgeois
liberty
and
equality
and
of
preaching
to
the
masses
that
they
had
nothing
to
gain
and
everything
to
lose
by
this
bourgeois
movement
german
socialism
forgot
in
the
nick
of
time
that
the
french
criticism
whose
silly
echo
it
was
presupposed
the
existence
of
modern
bourgeois
society
with
its
corresponding
economic
conditions
of
existence
and
the
political
constitution
adapted
thereto
the
very
things
whose
attainment
was
the
object
of
the
pending
struggle
in
germany
to
the
absolute
governments
with
their
following
of
parsons
professors
country
squires
and
officials
it
served
as
a
welcome
scarecrow
against
the
threatening
bourgeoisie
it
was
a
sweet
finish
after
the
bitter
pills
of
flogging
and
bullets
with
which
these
same
governments
just
at
that
time
dosed
the
german
working
class
risings
while
this
true
socialism
thus
served
the
government
as
a
weapon
for
fighting
the
german
bourgeoisie
it
at
the
same
time
directly
represented
a
reactionary
interest
the
interest
of
german
philistines
in
germany
the
petty
bourgeois
class
a
relic
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
since
then
constantly
cropping
up
again

this

wrapped

went
to
the
extreme
length
of
directly
opposing

destructive

of
proclaiming

and

as

the

without

necessarily
resulting
therefrom
they
desire
the
existing
state
of
society
minus
its
revolutionary
and
disintegrating
elements
they
wish
for
a
bourgeoisie
without
a
proletariat
the
bourgeoisie
naturally
conceives
the
world
in
which
it
is
supreme
to
be
the
best
and
bourgeois
socialism
develops
this
comfortable
conception
into
various
more
or
less
complete
systems
in
requiring
the
proletariat
to
carry
out
such
a
system
and
thereby
to
march
straightway
into
the
social
new
jerusalem
it
but
requires
in
reality
that
the
proletariat
should
remain
within
the
bounds
of
existing
society
but
should
cast
away
all
its
hateful
ideas
concerning
the
bourgeoisie
a
second
and
more
practical
but
less
systematic
form
of
this
socialism
sought
to
depreciate
every
revolutionary
movement
in
the
eyes
of
the
working
class
by
showing
that
no
mere
political
reform
but
only
a
change
in
the
material
conditions
of
existence
in
economical
relations
could
be
of
any
advantage
to
them
by
changes
in
the
material
conditions
of
existence
this
form
of
socialism
however
by
no
means
understands
abolition
of
the
bourgeois
relations
of
production
an
abolition
that
can
be
affected
only
by
a
revolution
but
administrative
reforms
based
on
the
continued
existence
of
these
relations
reforms
therefore
that
in
no
respect
affect
the
relations
between
capital
and

but
at
the
best
lessen
the
cost
and
simplify
the
administrative
work
of
bourgeois

the
revolutionary
storm
of
swept
away
this
whole
shabby
tendency
and
cured
its

of

we

here
refer
to
that
literature
which
in

great
modern
revolution
has
always
given
voice
to
the
demands
of
the
proletariat
such
as
the
writings
of
babeuf
and
others
the
first
direct
attempts
of
the
proletariat
to
attain
its
own
ends
made
in
times
of
universal
excitement
when
feudal
society
was
being
overthrown
necessarily
failed
owing
to
the
then
undeveloped
state
of
the
proletariat
as
well
as
to
the
absence
of
the
economic
conditions
for
its
emancipation
conditions
that
had
yet
to
be
produced
and
could
be
produced
by
the
impending
bourgeois
epoch
alone
the
revolutionary
literature
that
accompanied
these
first
movements
of
the
proletariat
had
necessarily
a
reactionary
character
it
inculcated
universal
asceticism
and
social
levelling
in
its
crudest
form
the
socialist
and
communist
systems
properly
so
called
those
of
saint
simon
fourier
owen
and
others
spring
into
existence
in
the
early
undeveloped
period
described
above
of
the
struggle
between
proletariat
and
bourgeoisie
see
section
i
bourgeois
and
proletarians
the
founders
of
these
systems
see
indeed
the
class
antagonisms
as
well
as
the
action
of
the
decomposing
elements
in
the
prevailing
form
of
society
but
the
proletariat
as
yet
in
its
infancy
offers
to
them
the
spectacle
of
a
class
without
any
historical
initiative
or
any
independent
political
movement
since
the
development
of
class
antagonism
keeps
even
pace
with
the
development
of
industry
the
economic
situation
as
they
find
it
does
not
as
yet
offer
to
them
the
material
conditions
for
the
emancipation
of
the
proletariat
they
therefore
search
after
a
new
social
science
after
new
social
laws
that
are
to
create
these
conditions
historical
action
is
to
yield
to
their
personal
inventive
action
historically
created
conditions
of
emancipation
to
fantastic
ones
and
the
gradual
spontaneous
class
organisation
of
the
proletariat
to
an
organisation
of
society
especially
contrived
by
these
inventors
future
history
resolves
itself
in
their
eyes
into
the
propaganda
and
the
practical
carrying
out
of
their
social
plans
in
the
formation
of
their
plans
they
are
conscious
of
caring
chiefly
for
the
interests
of
the
working
class
as
being
the
most
suffering
class
only
from
the
point
of
view
of
being
the
most
suffering
class
does
the
proletariat
exist
for
them
the
undeveloped
state
of
the
class
struggle
as
well
as
their
own
surroundings
causes
socialists
of
this
kind
to
consider
themselves
far
superior
to
all
class
antagonisms
they
want
to
improve
the
condition
of
every
member
of
society
even
that
of
the
most
favoured
hence
they
habitually
appeal
to
society
at
large
without
the
distinction
of
class
nay
by
preference
to
the
ruling
class
for
how
can
people
when
once
they
understand
their
system
fail
to
see
in
it
the
best
possible
plan
of
the
best
possible
state
of
society
hence
they
reject
all
political
and
especially
all
revolutionary
action
they
wish
to
attain
their
ends
by
peaceful
means
necessarily
doomed
to
failure
and
by
the
force
of
example
to
pave
the
way
for
the
new
social
gospel
such
fantastic
pictures
of
future
society
painted
at
a
time
when
the
proletariat
is
still
in
a
very
undeveloped
state
and
has
but
a
fantastic
conception
of
its
own
position
correspond
with
the
first
instinctive
yearnings
of
that
class
for
a
general
reconstruction
of

chapter

socialist
and
communist
literature
but
these
socialist
and
communist
publications
contain
also
a
critical
element
they
attack
every
principle
of
existing
society
hence
they
are
full
of
the
most
valuable
materials
for
the
enlightenment
of
the
working
class
the
practical
measures
proposed
in
them
such
as
the
abolition
of
the
distinction
between
town
and
country
of
the
family
of
the
carrying
on
of
industries
for
the
account
of
private
individuals
and
of
the
wage
system
the
proclamation
of
social
harmony
the
conversion
of
the
function
of
the
state
into
a
mere
superintendence
of
production
all
these
proposals
point
solely
to
the
disappearance
of
class
antagonisms
which
were
at
that
time
only
just
cropping
up
and
which
in
these
publications
are
recognised
in
their
earliest
indistinct
and
undefined
forms
only
these
proposals
therefore
are
of
a
purely
utopian
character
the
significance
of
critical
utopian
socialism
and
communism
bears
an
inverse
relation
to
historical
development
in
proportion
as
the
modern
class
struggle
develops
and
takes
definite
shape
this
fantastic
standing
apart
from
the
contest
these
fantastic
attacks
on
it
lose
all
practical
value
and
all
theoretical
justification
therefore
although
the
originators
of
these
systems
were
in
many
respects
revolutionary
their
disciples
have
in
every
case
formed
mere
reactionary
sects
they
hold
fast
by
the
original
views
of
their
masters
in
opposition
to
the
progressive
historical
development
of
the
proletariat
they
therefore
endeavour
and
that
consistently
to
deaden
the
class
struggle
and
to
reconcile
the
class
antagonisms
they
still
dream
of
experimental
realisation
of
their
social
utopias
of
founding
isolated
phalansteres
of
establishing
home

or
setting
up
a
little
icaria
duodecimo
editions
of
the
new
jerusalem
and
to
realise
all
these
castles
in
the
air
they
are
compelled
to
appeal
to
the
feelings
and
purses
of
the
bourgeois
by
degrees
they
sink
into
the
category
of
the
reactionary
or
conservative
socialists
depicted
above
differing
from
these
only
by
more
systematic
pedantry
and
by
their
fanatical
and
superstitious
belief
in
the
miraculous
effects
of
their
social
science
they
therefore
violently
oppose
all
political
action
on
the
part
of
the
working
class
such
action
according
to
them
can
only
result

that
party
which
fomented

the
bourgeoisie
whenever
it
acts
in
a

way
against
the
absolute
monarchy
the
feudal
squirearchy
and
the
petty
bourgeoisie
but
they
never
cease
for
a

instant
to
instil
into
the
working

the
clearest
possible
recognition
of
the
hostile
antagonism
between

and

in

that
the
german

may
straightway
use
as
so
many
weapons
against

that

to

in
short
the
communists
everywhere
support
every
revolutionary
movement
against
the
existing
social
and
political
order
of
things
in
all
these
movements
they
bring
to
the
front
as
the
leading
question
in
each
the
property
question
no
matter
what
its
degree
of
development
at
the
time
finally
they
labour
everywhere
for
the
union
and
agreement
of
the
democratic
parties
of
all
countries
the
communists
disdain
to
conceal
their
views
and
aims
they
openly
declare
that
their
ends
can
be
attained
only
by
the
forcible
overthrow
of
all
existing
social
conditions
let
the
ruling
classes
tremble
at
a
communistic
revolution
the
proletarians
have
nothing
to
lose
but
their
chains
they
have
a
world
to
win

dear

not
until
this

was
it
decided
that
i
should
be
coming

in

you
take

that

and
you
ll
arrive
at
about
the
same
time
as
i
do
tuesday
evening
verte
pto
give
a
little
thought
to
the
confession
of
faith
i
think
we
would
do
best
to
abandon
the
catechetical
form
and
call
the
thing
communist
manifesto
since
a
certain
amount
of
history
has
to
be
narrated
in
it
the
form
hitherto
adopted
is
quite
unsuitable
i
shall
be
bringing
with
me
the
one
from
here
which
i
did
principles
of
communism
it
is
in
simple
narrative
form
but
wretchedly
worded
in
a
tearing
hurry
i
start
off
by
asking
what
is
communism
and
then
straight
on
to
the
proletariat
the
history
of
its
origins
how
it
differs
from
earlier
workers
development
of
the
antithesis
between
the
proletariat
and
the
bourgeoisie
crises
conclusions
in
between
all
kinds
of
secondary
matter
and
finally
the
communists
party
policy
in
so
far
as
it
should
be
made
public
the
one
here
has
not
yet
been
submitted
in
its
entirety
for
endorsement
but
save
for
a
few
quite
minor
points
i
think
i
can
get
it
through
in
such
a
form
that
at
least
there
is
nothing
in
it
which
conflicts
with
our
views
from
mecw

draft
of
a
communist
confession
of
faith
this
document
is
the
draft
programme
discussed
at
the
first
congress
of
the
communist
league
in
london
on
june
the
congress
was
a
final
stage
in
the
reorganisation
of
the
league
of
the
just
an
organisation
of
german
workers
and
craftsmen
which
was
founded
in
paris
in
and
soon
acquired
an
international
character
having
communities
in
germany
france
switzerland
britain
and
sweden
the
activity
of
marx
and
engels
directed
towards
the
ideological
and
organisational
unity
of
the
socialists
and
advanced
workers
prompted
the
leaders
of
the
league
karl
schapper
joseph
moll
heinrich
bauer
who
resided
in
london
front
november
to
ask
for
their
help
in
reorganising
the
league
and
drafting
its
new
program
me
when
marx
and
engels
were
convinced
that
the
leaders
of
the
league
of
the
just
were
ready
to
accept
the
principles
of
scientific
communism
as
its
programme
they
accepted
the
offer
to
join
the
league
made
to
them
late
in
january
engels
active
participation
in
the
work
of
the
congress
marx
was
unable
to
go
to
london
affected
the
course
and
the
results
of
its
proceedings
the
league
was
renamed
the
communist
league
the
old
motto
of
the
league
of
the
just
all
men
are
brothers
was
replaced
by
a
new
marxist
one
working
men
of
all
countries
unite
the
draft
programme
and
the
draft
rules
of
the
league
were
approved
at
the
last
sitting
on
june
the
full
text
of
the
draft
of
a
communist
confession
of
faith
credo
became
known
only
in
it
was
found
by
the
swiss
scholar
bert
andr
as
together
with
the
draft
rules
and
the
circular
of
the
first
congress
to
the
members
of
the
league
in
the
archives
of
joachim
friedrich
martens
an
active
member
of
the
communist
league
which
are
kept
in
the
state
and
university
library
in
hamburg
this
discovery
made
it
possible
to
ascertain
a
number
of
important
points
in
the
history
of
the
communist
league
and
the
drafting
of
its
programme
documents
it
had
been
previously
assumed
that
the
first
congress
did
no
more
than
adopt
a
decision
to
draw
up
a
programme
and
that
the
draft
itself
was
made
by
the
london
central
authority
of
the
communist
league
joseph
moll
karl
schapper
and
heinrich
bauer
after
the
congress
between
june
and
august
the
new
documents
show
that
the
draft
was
ready
by
june
and
that
its
author
was
engels
the
manuscript
found
in
martens
archives
with
the
exception
of
some
inserted
words
the
concluding
sentence
and
the
signatures
of
the
president
and
the
secretary
of
the
congress
was
written
in
engels
hand
the
document
testifies
to
engels
great
influence
on
the
discussion
of
the
programme
at
the
congress
the
formulation
of
the
answers
to
most
of
the
questions
is
a
marxist
one
besides
while
drafting
the
programme
engels
had
to
take
into
account
that
the
members
of
the
league
had
not
yet
freed
themselves
from
the
influence
of
utopian
ideas
and
this
was
reflected
in
the
formulation
of
the
first
six
questions
and
answers
the
form
of
a
revolutionary
catechism
was
also
commonly
used
in
the
league
of
the
just
and
other
organisations
of
workers
and
craftsmen
at
the
time
it
may
he
assumed
that
engels
intended
to
give
greater
precision
to
some
of
the
formulations
of
the
programme
document
in
the
course
of
further
discussion
and
revision
after
the
first
congress
of
the
communist
league
the
draft
of
a
communist
confession
of
faith
was
sent
together
with
the
draft
rules
to
the
communities
for
discussion
the
results
of
which
were
to
be
taken
into
account
at
the
time
of
the
final
approval
of
the
programme
and
the
rules
at
the
second
congress
when
working
on
another
improved
draft
programme
the
principles
of
communism
in
late
october
engels
made
direct
use
of
the
confession
of
faith
as
can
be
seen
from
the
coincidences
of
the
texts
and
also
from
references
in
the
principles
to
the
earlier
document
when
engels
had
apparently
decided
to
leave
formulations
of
some
of
the
answers
as
they
were
from

question
are
you
a
communist
answer
yes
question
what
is
the
aim
of
the
communists
answer
to
organise
society
in
such
a
way
that
every
member
of
it
can
develop
and
use
all
his
capabilities
and
powers
in
complete
freedom
and
without
thereby
infringing
the
basic
conditions
of
this
society
question
how
do
you
wish
to
achieve
this
aim
answer
by
the
elimination
of
private
property
and
its
replacement
by
community
of
property
question
on
what
do
you
base
your
community
of
property
answer
firstly
on
the
mass
of
productive
forces
and
means
of
subsistence
resulting
from
the
development
of
industry
agriculture
trade
and
colonisation
and
on
the
possibility
inherent
in
machinery
chemical
and
other
resources
of
their
infinite
extension
secondly
on
the
fact
that
in
the
consciousness
or
feeling
of
every
individual
there
exist
certain
irrefutable
basic
principles
which
being
the
result
of
the
whole
of
historical
development
require
no
proof
question
what
are
such
principles
answer
for
example
every
individual
strives
to
be
happy
the
happiness
of
the
individual
is
inseparable
from
the
happiness
of
all
etc
question
how
do
you
wish
to
prepare
the
way
for
your
community
of
property
answer
by
enlightening
and
uniting
the
proletariat
question
what
is
the
proletariat
answer
the
proletariat
is
that
class
of
society
which
lives
exclusively
by
its
labour
and
not
on
the
profit
from
any
kind
of
capital
that
class
whose
weal
and
woe
whose
life
and
death
therefore
depend
on
the
alternation
of
times
of
good
and
bad
business
in
a
word
on
the
fluctuations
of
competition
question
then
there
have
not
always
been
proletarians
answer
no
there
have
always
been
poor
and
working
classes
and
those
who
worked
were
almost
always
the
poor
but
there
have
not
always
been
proletarians
just
as
competition
has
not
always
been
free
question
how
did
the
proletariat
arise
answer
the
proletariat
came
into
being
as
a
result
of
the
introduction
of
the
machines
which
have
been
invented
since
the
middle
of
the
last
century
and
the
most
important
of
which
are
the
steam
engine
the
spinning
machine
and
the
power
loom
these
machines
which
were
very
expensive
and
could
therefore
only
be
purchased
by
rich
people
supplanted
the
workers
of
the
time
because
by
the
use
of
machinery
it
was
possible
to
produce
commodities
more
quickly
and
cheaply
than
could
the
workers
with
their
imperfect
spinning
wheels
and
handlooms
the
machines
thus
delivered
industry
entirely
into
the
hands
of
the
big
capitalists
and
rendered
the
workers
scanty
property
which
consisted
mainly
of
their
tools
looms
etc
quite
worthless
so
that
the
capitalist
was
left
with
everything
the
worker
with
nothing
in
this
way
the
factory
system
was
draft
of
a
communist
confession
of
faith
introduced
once
the
capitalists
saw
how
advantageous
this
was
for
them
they
sought
to
extend
it
to
more
and
more
branches
of
labour
they
divided
work
more
and
more
between
the
workers
so
that
workers
who
formerly
had
made
a
whole
article
now
produced
only
a
part
of
it
labour
simplified
in
this
way
produced
goods
more
quickly
and
therefore
more
cheaply
and
only
now
was
it
found
in
almost
every
branch
of
labour
that
here
also
machines
could
be
used
as
soon
as
any
branch
of
labour
went
over
to
factory
production
it
ended
up
just
as
in
the
case
of
spinning
and
weaving
in
the
hands
of
the
big
capitalists
and
the
workers
were
deprived
of
the
last
remnants
of
their
independence
we
have
gradually
arrived
at
the
position
where
almost
all
branches
of
labour
are
run
on
a
factory
basis
this
has
increasingly
brought
about
the
ruin
of
the
previously
existing
middle
class
especially
of
the
small
master
craftsmen
completely
transformed
the
previous
position
of
the
workers
and
two
new
classes
which
are
gradually
swallowing
up
all
other
classes
have
come
into
being
namely
i
the
class
of
the
big
capitalists
who
in
all
advanced
countries
are
in
almost
exclusive
possession
of
the
means
of
subsistence
and
those
means
machines
factories
workshops
etc
by
which
these
means
of
subsistence
are
produced
this
is
the
bourgeois
class
or
the
bourgeoisie
ii
the
class
of
the
completely
propertyless
who
are
compelled
to
sell
their
labour
to
the
first
class
the
bourgeois
simply
to
obtain
from
them
in
return
their
means
of
subsistence
since
the
parties
to
this
trading
in
labour
are
not
equal
but
the
bourgeois
have
the
advantage
the
propertyless
must
submit
to
the
bad
conditions
laid
down
by
the
bourgeois
this
class
dependent
on
the
bourgeois
is
called
the
class
of
the
proletarians
or
the
proletariat
question
in
what
way
does
the
proletarian
differ
from
the
slave
answer
the
slave
is
sold
once
and
for
all
the
proletarian
has
to
sell
himself
by
the
day
and
by
the
hour
the
slave
is
the
property
of
one
master
and
for
that
very
reason
has
a
guaranteed
subsistence
however
wretched
it
may
be
the
proletarian
is
so
to
speak
the
slave
of
the
entire
bourgeois
class
not
of
one
master
and
therefore
has
no
guaranteed
subsistence
since
nobody
buys
his
labour
if
he
does
not
need
it
the
slave
is
accounted
a
thing
and
not
a
member
of
civil
society
the
proletarian
is
recognised
as
a
person
as
a
member
of
civil
society
the
slave
may
therefore
have
a
better
subsistence
than
the
proletarian
but
the
latter
stands
at
a
higher
stage
of
development
the
slave
frees
himself
by
becoming
a
proletarian
abolishing
from
the
totality
of
property
relationships
only
the
relationship
of
slavery
the
proletarian
can
free
himself
only
by
abolishing
property
in
general
question
in
what
way
does
the
proletarian
differ
from
the
serf
answer
the
serf
has
the
use
of
a
piece
of
land
that
is
of
an
instrument
of
production
in
return
for
handing
over
a
greater
or
lesser
portion
of
the
yield
the
proletarian
works
with
instruments
of
production
which
belong
to
someone
else
who
in
return
for
his
labour
hands
over
to
him
a
portion
determined
by
competition
of
the
products
in
the
case
of
the
serf
the
share
of
the
labourer
is
determined
by
his
own
labour
that
is
by
himself
in
the
case
of
the
proletarian
it
is
determined
by
competition
therefore
in
the
first
place
by
the
bourgeois
the
serf
has
guaranteed
subsistence
the
proletarian
has
not
the
serf
frees
himself
by
driving
out
his
feudal
lord
and
becoming
a
property
owner
himself
thus
entering
into
competition
and
joining
for
the
time
being
the
possessing
class
the
privileged
class
the
proletarian
frees
himself
by
doing
away
with
property
competition
and
all
class
differences
draft
of
a
communist
confession
of
faith
question
in
what
way
does
the
proletarian
differ
from
the
handicraftsman
answer
as
opposed
to
the
proletarian
the
so
called
handicraftsman
who
still
existed
nearly
everywhere
during
the
last
century
and
still
exists
here
and
there
is
at
most
a
temporary
proletarian
his
aim
is
to
acquire
capital
himself
and
so
to
exploit
other
workers
he
can
often
achieve
this
aim
where
the
craft
guilds
still
exist
or
where
freedom
to
follow
a
trade
has
not
yet
led
to
the
organisation
of
handwork
on
a
factory
basis
and
to
intense
competition
but
as
soon
as
the
factory
system
is
introduced
into
handwork
and
competition
is
in
full
swing
this
prospect
is
eliminated
and
the
handicraftsman
becomes
more
and
more
a
proletarian
the
handicraftsman
therefore
frees
himself
either
by
becoming
a
bourgeois
or
in
general
passing
over
into
the
middle
class
or
by
becoming
a
proletarian
as
a
result
of
competition
as
now
happens
in
most
cases
and
joining
the
movement
of
the
proletariat
i
e
the
more
or
less
conscious
communist
movement
question
then
you
do
not
believe
that
community
of
property
has
been
possible
at
any
time
answer
no
communism
has
only
arisen
since
machinery
and
other
inventions
made
it
possible
to
hold
out
the
prospect
of
an
all
sided
development
a
happy
existence
for
all
members
of
society
communism
is
the
theory
of
a
liberation
which
was
not
possible
for
the
slaves
the
serfs
or
the
handicraftsmen
but
only
for
the
proletarians
and
hence
it
belongs
of
necessity
to
the
th
century
and
was
not
possible
in
any
earlier
period
question
let
m
go
back
to
the
sixth
question
as
you
wish
to
prepare
for
community
of
property
by
the
enlightening
and
uniting
of
the
proletariat
then
you
reject
revolution
answer
we
are
convinced
not
only
of
the
uselessness
but
even
of
the
harmfulness
of
all
conspiracies
we
are
also
aware
that
revolutions
are
not
made
deliberately
and
arbitrarily
but
that
everywhere
and
at
all
times
they
are
the
necessary
consequence
of
circumstances
which
are
not
in
any
way
whatever
dependent
either
on
the
will
or
on
the
leadership
of
individual
parties
or
of
whole
classes
but
we
also
see
that
the
development
of
the
proletariat
in
almost
all
countries
of
the
world
is
forcibly
repressed
by
the
possessing
classes
and
that
thus
a
revolution
is
being
forcibly
worked
for
by
the
opponents
of
communism
if
in
the
end
the
oppressed
proletariat
is
thus
driven
into
a
revolution
then
we
will
defend
the
cause
of
the
proletariat
just
as
well
by
our
deeds
as
now
by
our
words
question
do
you
intend
to
replace
the
existing
social
order
by
community
of
property
at
one
stroke
answer
we
have
no
such
intention
the
development
of
the
masses
cannot
he
ordered
by
decree
it
is
determined
by
the
development
of
the
conditions
in
which
these
masses
live
and
therefore
proceeds
gradually
question
how
do
you
think
the
transition
from
the
present
situation
to
community
of
property
is
to
be
effected
answer
the
first
fundamental
condition
for
the
introduction
of
community
of
property
is
the
political
liberation
of
the
proletariat
through
a
democratic
constitution
question
what
will
be
your
first
measure
once
you
have
established
democracy
answer
guaranteeing
the
subsistence
of
the
proletariat
question
how
will
you
do
this
draft
of
a
communist
confession
of
faith
answer
i
by
limiting
private
property
in
such
a
way
that
it
gradually
prepares
the
way
for
its
transformation
into
social
property
e
g
by
progressive
taxation
limitation
of
the
right
of
inheritance
in
favour
of
the
state
etc
etc
ii
by
employing
workers
in
national
workshops
and
factories
and
on
national
estates
iii
by
educating
all
children
at
the
expense
of
the
state
question
how
will
you
arrange
this
kind
of
education
during
the
period
of
transition
answer
all
children
will
be
educated
in
state
establishments
from
the
time
when
they
can
do
without
the
first
maternal
care
question
will
not
the
introduction
of
community
of
property
be
accompanied
by
the
proclamation
of
the
community
of
women
answer
by
no
means
we
will
only
interfere
in
the
personal
relationship
between
men
and
women
or
with
the
family
in
general
to
the
extent
that
the
maintenance
of
the
existing
institution
would
disturb
the
new
social
order
besides
we
are
well
aware
that
the
family
relationship
has
been
modified
in
the
course
of
history
by
the
property
relationships
and
by
periods
of
development
and
that
consequently
the
ending
of
private
property
will
also
have
a
most
important
influence
on
it
question
will
nationalities
continue
to
exist
under
communism
answer
the
nationalities
of
the
peoples
who
join
together
according
to
the
principle
of
community
will
be
just
as
much
compelled
by
this
union
to
merge
with
one
another
and
thereby
supersede
themselves
as
the
various
differences
between
estates
and
classes
disappear
through
the
superseding
of
their
basis
private
property
question
do
communists
reject
existing
religions
answer
all
religions
which
have
existed
hitherto
were
expressions
of
historical
stages
of
development
of
individual
peoples
or
groups
of
peoples
but
communism
is
that
stage
of
historical
development
which
makes
all
existing
religions
superfluous
and
supersedes
them

the

as
principles

was

in

which
was
also
the

it
was
decided
to
issue
a
draft

to
be
submitted
for
discussion
to
the
sections
of
the
league
the
document
which
has
now
come
to
light
is
almost
certainly
this
draft
comparison
of
the
two
documents
shows
that
principles

communism
is
a
revised
edition
of
this
earlier
draft
in
principles
of
communism
engels
left
three
questions
unanswered
in
two
cases
with
the
notation
unchanged
bleibt
this
clearly
refers
to
the
answers
provided
in
the
earlier
draft
the
new
draft
for
the
programme
was
worked
out
by
engels
on
the
instructions
of
the
leading
body
of
the
paris
circle
of
the
communist
league
the
instructions
were
decided
on
after
engels
sharp
criticism
at
the
committee
meeting
on
october
of
the
draft
programme
drawn
up
by
the
true
socialist
moses
hess
which
was
then
rejected
still
considering
principles
of
communism
as
a
preliminary
draft
engels
expressed
the
view
in
a
letter
to
marx
dated
november
that
it
would
be
best
to
drop
the
old
catechistic
form
and
draw
up
a
programme
in
the
form
of
a
manifesto
at
the
second
congress
of
the
communist
league
november
december
marx
and
engels
defended
the
fundamental
scientific
principles
of
communism
and
were
trusted
with
drafting
a
programme
in
the
form
of
a
manifesto
of
the
communist
party
in
writing
the
manifesto
the
founders
of
marxism
made
use
of
the
propositions
enunciated
in
principles
of
communism
engels
uses
the
term
manufaktur
and
its
derivatives
which
have
been
translated
manufacture
manufacturing
etc
engels
used
this
word
literally
to
indicate
production
by
hand
not
factory
production
for
which
engels
uses
big
industry
manufaktur
differs
from
handicraft
guild
production
in
mediaeval
towns
in
that
the
latter
was
carried
out
by
independent
artisans
manufacktur
is
carried
out
by
homeworkers
working
for
merchant
capitalists
or
by
groups
of
craftspeople
working
together
in
large
workshops
owned
by
capitalists
it
is
therefore
a
transitional
mode
of
production
between
guild
handicraft
and
modern
capitalist

draft
of
a

the
principles
of
communism
what
is
communism
communism
is
the
doctrine
of
the
conditions
of
the
liberation
of
the
proletariat
what
is
the
proletariat
the
proletariat
is
that
class
in
society
which
lives
entirely
from
the
sale
of
its
labor
and
does
not
draw
profit
from
any
kind
of
capital
whose
weal
and
woe
whose
life
and
death
whose
sole
existence
depends
on
the
demand
for
labor
hence
on
the
changing
state
of
business
on
the
vagaries
of
unbridled
competition
the
proletariat
or
the
class
of
proletarians
is
in
a
word
the
working
class
of
the
th
century
proletarians
then
have
not
always
existed
no
there
have
always
been
poor
and
working
classes
and
the
working
class
have
mostly
been
poor
but
there
have
not
always
been
workers
and
poor
people
living
under
conditions
as
they
are
today
in
other
words
there
have
not
always
been
proletarians
any
more
than
there
has
always
been
free
unbridled
competitions
how
did
the
proletariat
originate
the
proletariat
originated
in
the
industrial
revolution
which
took
place
in
england
in
the
last
half
of
the
last
th
century
and
which
has
since
then
been
repeated
in
all
the
civilized
countries
of
the
world
this
industrial
revolution
was
precipitated
by
the
discovery
of
the
steam
engine
various
spinning
machines
the
mechanical
loom
and
a
whole
series
of
other
mechanical
devices
these
machines
which
were
very
expensive
and
hence
could
be
bought
only
by
big
capitalists
altered
the
whole
mode
of
production
and
displaced
the
former
workers
because
the
machines
turned
out
cheaper
and
better
commodities
than
the
workers
could
produce
with
their
inefficient
spinning
wheels
and
handlooms
the
machines
delivered
industry
wholly
into
the
hands
of
the
big
capitalists
and
rendered
entirely
worthless
the
meagre
property
of
the
workers
tools
looms
etc
the
result
was
that
the
capitalists
soon
had
everything
in
their
hands
and
nothing
remained
to
the
workers
this
marked
the
introduction
of
the
factory
system
into
the
textile
industry
once
the
impulse
to
the
introduction
of
machinery
and
the
factory
system
had
been
given
this
system
spread
quickly
to
all
other
branches
of
industry
especially
cloth
and
book
printing
pottery
and
the
metal
industries
labor
was
more
and
more
divided
among
the
individual
workers
so
that
the
worker
who
previously
had
done
a
complete
piece
of
work
now
did
only
a
part
of
that
piece
this
division
of
labor
made
it
possible
to
produce
things
faster
and
cheaper
it
reduced
the
activity
of
the
individual
worker
to
simple
endlessly
repeated
mechanical
motions
which
could
be
performed
not
only
as
well
but
much
better
by
a
machine
in
this
way
all
these
industries
fell
one
after
another
under
the
dominance
of
steam
machinery
and
the
factory
system
just
as
spinning
and
weaving
had
already
done
but
at
the
same
time
they
also
fell
into
the
hands
of
big
capitalists
and
their
workers
were
deprived
of
whatever
independence
remained
to
them
gradually
not
only
genuine
manufacture
but
also
handicrafts
came
within
the
province
of
the
factory
system
as
big
capitalists
increasingly
draft
of
a
communist
confession
of
faith
displaced
the
small
master
craftsmen
by
setting
up
huge
workshops
which
saved
many
expenses
and
permitted
an
elaborate
division
of
labor
this
is
how
it
has
come
about
that
in
civilized
countries
at
the
present
time
nearly
all
kinds
of
labor
are
performed
in
factories
and
in
nearly
all
branches
of
work
handicrafts
and
manufacture
have
been
superseded
this
process
has
to
an
ever
greater
degree
ruined
the
old
middle
class
especially
the
small
handicraftsmen
it
has
entirely
transformed
the
condition
of
the
workers
and
two
new
classes
have
been
created
which
are
gradually
swallowing
up
all
the
others
these
are
i
the
class
of
big
capitalists
who
in
all
civilized
countries
are
already
in
almost
exclusive
possession
of
all
the
means
of
subsistence
and
of
the
instruments
machines
factories
and
materials
necessary
for
the
production
of
the
means
of
subsistence
this
is
the
bourgeois
class
or
the
bourgeoisie
ii
the
class
of
the
wholly
propertyless
who
are
obliged
to
sell
their
labor
to
the
bourgeoisie
in
order
to
get
in
exchange
the
means
of
subsistence
for
their
support
this
is
called
the
class
of
proletarians
or
the
proletariat
under
what
conditions
does
this
sale
of
the
labor
of
the
proletarians
to
the
bourgeoisie
take
place
labor
is
a
commodity
like
any
other
and
its
price
is
therefore
determined
by
exactly
the
same
laws
that
apply
to
other
commodities
in
a
regime
of
big
industry
or
of
free
competition
as
we
shall
see
the
two
come
to
the
same
thing
the
price
of
a
commodity
is
on
the
average
always
equal
to
its
cost
of
production
hence
the
price
of
labor
is
also
equal
to
the
cost
of
production
of
labor
but
the
costs
of
production
of
labor
consist
of
precisely
the
quantity
of
means
of
subsistence
necessary
to
enable
the
worker
to
continue
working
and
to
prevent
the
working
class
from
dying
out
the
worker
will
therefore
get
no
more
for
his
labor
than
is
necessary
for
this
purpose
the
price
of
labor
or
the
wage
will
in
other
words
be
the
lowest
the
minimum
required
for
the
maintenance
of
life
however
since
business
is
sometimes
better
and
sometimes
worse
it
follows
that
the
worker
sometimes
gets
more
and
sometimes
gets
less
for
his
commodities
but
again
just
as
the
industrialist
on
the
average
of
good
times
and
bad
gets
no
more
and
no
less
for
his
commodities
than
what
they
cost
similarly
on
the
average
the
worker
gets
no
more
and
no
less
than
his
minimum
this
economic
law
of
wages
operates
the
more
strictly
the
greater
the
degree
to
which
big
industry
has
taken
possession
of
all
branches
of
production
what
working
classes
were
there
before
the
industrial
revolution
the
working
classes
have
always
according
to
the
different
stages
of
development
of
society
lived
in
different
circumstances
and
had
different
relations
to
the
owning
and
ruling
classes
in
antiquity
the
workers
were
the
slaves
of
the
owners
just
as
they
still
are
in
many
backward
countries
and
even
in
the
southern
part
of
the
united
states
in
the
middle
ages
they
were
the
serfs
of
the
land
owning
nobility
as
they
still
are
in
hungary
poland
and
russia
in
the
middle
ages
and
indeed
right
up
to
the
industrial
revolution
there
were
also
journeymen
in
the
cities
who
worked
in
the
service
of
petty
bourgeois
masters
draft
of
a
communist
confession
of
faith
gradually
as
manufacture
developed
these
journeymen
became
manufacturing
workers
who
were
even
then
employed
by
larger
capitalists
in
what
way
do
proletarians
differ
from
slaves
the
slave
is
sold
once
and
for
all
the
proletarian
must
sell
himself
daily
and
hourly
the
individual
slave
property
of
one
master
is
assured
an
existence
however
miserable
it
may
be
because
of
the
master
s
interest
the
individual
proletarian
property
as
it
were
of
the
entire
bourgeois
class
which
buys
his
labor
only
when
someone
has
need
of
it
has
no
secure
existence
this
existence
is
assured
only
to
the
class
as
a
whole
the
slave
is
outside
competition
the
proletarian
is
in
it
and
experiences
all
its
vagaries
the
slave
counts
as
a
thing
not
as
a
member
of
society
thus
the
slave
can
have
a
better
existence
than
the
proletarian
while
the
proletarian
belongs
to
a
higher
stage
of
social
development
and
himself
stands
on
a
higher
social
level
than
the
slave
the
slave
frees
himself
when
of
all
the
relations
of
private
property
he
abolishes
only
the
relation
of
slavery
and
thereby
becomes
a
proletarian
the
proletarian
can
free
himself
only
by
abolishing
private
property
in
general
in
what
way
do
proletarians
differ
from
serfs
the
serf
possesses
and
uses
an
instrument
of
production
a
piece
of
land
in
exchange
for
which
he
gives
up
a
part
of
his
product
or
part
of
the
services
of
his
labor
the
proletarian
works
with
the
instruments
of
production
of
another
for
the
account
of
this
other
in
exchange
for
a
part
of
the
product
the
serf
gives
up
the
proletarian
receives
the
serf
has
an
assured
existence
the
proletarian
has
not
the
serf
is
outside
competition
the
proletarian
is
in
it
the
serf
liberates
himself
in
one
of
three
ways
either
he
runs
away
to
the
city
and
there
becomes
a
handicraftsman
or
instead
of
products
and
services
he
gives
money
to
his
lord
and
thereby
becomes
a
free
tenant
or
he
overthrows
his
feudal
lord
and
himself
becomes
a
property
owner
in
short
by
one
route
or
another
he
gets
into
the
owning
class
and
enters
into
competition
the
proletarian
liberates
himself
by
abolishing
competition
private
property
and
all
class
differences
in
what
way
do
proletarians
differ
from
handicraftsmen
in
contrast
to
the
proletarian
the
so
called
handicraftsman
as
he
still
existed
almost
everywhere
in
the
past
eighteenth
century
and
still
exists
here
and
there
at
present
is
a
proletarian
at
most
temporarily
his
goal
is
to
acquire
capital
himself
wherewith
to
exploit
other
workers
he
can
often
achieve
this
goal
where
guilds
still
exist
or
where
freedom
from
guild
restrictions
has
not
yet
led
to
the
introduction
of
factory
style
methods
into
the
crafts
nor
yet
to
fierce
competition
but
as
soon
as
the
factory
system
has
been
introduced
into
the
crafts
and
competition
flourishes
fully
this
perspective
dwindles
away
and
the
handicraftsman
becomes
more
and
more
a
proletarian
the
handicraftsman
therefore
frees
himself
by
becoming
either
bourgeois
or
entering
the
middle
class
in
general
or
becoming
a
proletarian
because
of
competition
as
is
now
more
often
the
case
in
which
case
he
can
free
himself
by
joining
the
proletarian
movement
i
e
the
more
or
less
communist
movement
draft
of
a
communist
confession
of
faith
in
what
way
do
proletarians
differ
from
manufacturing
workers
the
manufacturing
worker
of
the
th
to
the
th
centuries
still
had
with
but
few
exception
an
instrument
of
production
in
his
own
possession
his
loom
the
family
spinning
wheel
a
little
plot
of
land
which
he
cultivated
in
his
spare
time
the
proletarian
has
none
of
these
things
the
manufacturing
worker
almost
always
lives
in
the
countryside
and
in
a
more
or
less
patriarchal
relation
to
his
landlord
or
employer
the
proletarian
lives
for
the
most
part
in
the
city
and
his
relation
to
his
employer
is
purely
a
cash
relation
the
manufacturing
worker
is
torn
out
of
his
patriarchal
relation
by
big
industry
loses
whatever
property
he
still
has
and
in
this
way
becomes
a
proletarian
what
were
the
immediate
consequences
of
the
industrial
revolution
and
of
the
division
of
society
into
bourgeoisie
and
proletariat
first
the
lower
and
lower
prices
of
industrial
products
brought
about
by
machine
labor
totally
destroyed
in
all
countries
of
the
world
the
old
system
of
manufacture
or
industry
based
upon
hand
labor
in
this
way
all
semi
barbarian
countries
which
had
hitherto
been
more
or
less
strangers
to
historical
development
and
whose
industry
had
been
based
on
manufacture
were
violently
forced
out
of
their
isolation
they
bought
the
cheaper
commodities
of
the
english
and
allowed
their
own
manufacturing
workers
to
be
ruined
countries
which
had
known
no
progress
for
thousands
of
years
for
example
india
were
thoroughly
revolutionized
and
even
china
is
now
on
the
way
to
a
revolution
we
have
come
to
the
point
where
a
new
machine
invented
in
england
deprives
millions
of
chinese
workers
of
their
livelihood
within
a
year
s
time
in
this
way
big
industry
has
brought
all
the
people
of
the
earth
into
contact
with
each
other
has
merged
all
local
markets
into
one
world
market
has
spread
civilization
and
progress
everywhere
and
has
thus
ensured
that
whatever
happens
in
civilized
countries
will
have
repercussions
in
all
other
countries
it
follows
that
if
the
workers
in
england
or
france
now
liberate
themselves
this
must
set
off
revolution
in
all
other
countries
revolutions
which
sooner
or
later
must
accomplish
the
liberation
of
their
respective
working
class
second
wherever
big
industries
displaced
manufacture
the
bourgeoisie
developed
in
wealth
and
power
to
the
utmost
and
made
itself
the
first
class
of
the
country
the
result
was
that
wherever
this
happened
the
bourgeoisie
took
political
power
into
its
own
hands
and
displaced
the
hitherto
ruling
classes
the
aristocracy
the
guildmasters
and
their
representative
the
absolute
monarchy
the
bourgeoisie
annihilated
the
power
of
the
aristocracy
the
nobility
by
abolishing
the
entailment
of
estates
in
other
words
by
making
landed
property
subject
to
purchase
and
sale
and
by
doing
away
with
the
special
privileges
of
the
nobility
it
destroyed
the
power
of
the
guildmasters
by
abolishing
guilds
and
handicraft
privileges
in
their
place
it
put
competition
that
is
a
state
of
society
in
which
everyone
has
the
right
to
enter
into
any
branch
of
industry
the
only
obstacle
being
a
lack
of
the
necessary
capital
the
introduction
of
free
competition
is
thus
public
declaration
that
from
now
on
the
members
of
society
are
unequal
only
to
the
extent
that
their
capitals
are
unequal
that
capital
is
the
decisive
power
and
that
therefore
the
capitalists
the
bourgeoisie
have
become
the
first
class
in
society
draft
of
a
communist
confession
of
faith
free
competition
is
necessary
for
the
establishment
of
big
industry
because
it
is
the
only
condition
of
society
in
which
big
industry
can
make
its
way
having
destroyed
the
social
power
of
the
nobility
and
the
guildmasters
the
bourgeois
also
destroyed
their
political
power
having
raised
itself
to
the
actual
position
of
first
class
in
society
it
proclaims
itself
to
be
also
the
dominant
political
class
this
it
does
through
the
introduction
of
the
representative
system
which
rests
on
bourgeois
equality
before
the
law
and
the
recognition
of
free
competition
and
in
european
countries
takes
the
form
of
constitutional
monarchy
in
these
constitutional
monarchies
only
those
who
possess
a
certain
capital
are
voters
that
is
to
say
only
members
of
the
bourgeoisie
these
bourgeois
voters
choose
the
deputies
and
these
bourgeois
deputies
by
using
their
right
to
refuse
to
vote
taxes
choose
a
bourgeois
government
third
everywhere
the
proletariat
develops
in
step
with
the
bourgeoisie
in
proportion
as
the
bourgeoisie
grows
in
wealth
the
proletariat
grows
in
numbers
for
since
the
proletarians
can
be
employed
only
by
capital
and
since
capital
extends
only
through
employing
labor
it
follows
that
the
growth
of
the
proletariat
proceeds
at
precisely
the
same
pace
as
the
growth
of
capital
simultaneously
this
process
draws
members
of
the
bourgeoisie
and
proletarians
together
into
the
great
cities
where
industry
can
be
carried
on
most
profitably
and
by
thus
throwing
great
masses
in
one
spot
it
gives
to
the
proletarians
a
consciousness
of
their
own
strength
moreover
the
further
this
process
advances
the
more
new
labor
saving
machines
are
invented
the
greater
is
the
pressure
exercised
by
big
industry
on
wages
which
as
we
have
seen
sink
to
their
minimum
and
therewith
render
the
condition
of
the
proletariat
increasingly
unbearable
the
growing
dissatisfaction
of
the
proletariat
thus
joins
with
its
rising
power
to
prepare
a
proletarian
social
revolution
what
were
the
further
consequences
of
the
industrial
revolution
big
industry
created
in
the
steam
engine
and
other
machines
the
means
of
endlessly
expanding
industrial
production
speeding
it
up
and
cutting
its
costs
with
production
thus
facilitated
the
free
competition
which
is
necessarily
bound
up
with
big
industry
assumed
the
most
extreme
forms
a
multitude
of
capitalists
invaded
industry
and
in
a
short
while
more
was
produced
than
was
needed
as
a
consequence
finished
commodities
could
not
be
sold
and
a
so
called
commercial
crisis
broke
out
factories
had
to
be
closed
their
owners
went
bankrupt
and
the
workers
were
without
bread
deepest
misery
reigned
everywhere
after
a
time
the
superfluous
products
were
sold
the
factories
began
to
operate
again
wages
rose
and
gradually
business
got
better
than
ever
but
it
was
not
long
before
too
many
commodities
were
again
produced
and
a
new
crisis
broke
out
only
to
follow
the
same
course
as
its
predecessor
ever
since
the
beginning
of
this
th
century
the
condition
of
industry
has
constantly
fluctuated
between
periods
of
prosperity
and
periods
of
crisis
nearly
every
five
to
seven
years
a
fresh
crisis
has
intervened
always
with
the
greatest
hardship
for
workers
and
always
accompanied
by
general
revolutionary
stirrings
and
the
direct
peril
to
the
whole
existing
order
of
things
what
follows
from
these
periodic
commercial
crises
first
that
though
big
industry
in
its
earliest
stage
created
free
competition
it
has
now
outgrown
free
competition
draft
of
a
communist
confession
of
faith
that
for
big
industry
competition
and
generally
the
individualistic
organization
of
production
have
become
a
fetter
which
it
must
and
will
shatter
that
so
long
as
big
industry
remains
on
its
present
footing
it
can
be
maintained
only
at
the
cost
of
general
chaos
every
seven
years
each
time
threatening
the
whole
of
civilization
and
not
only
plunging
the
proletarians
into
misery
but
also
ruining
large
sections
of
the
bourgeoisie
hence
either
that
big
industry
must
itself
be
given
up
which
is
an
absolute
impossibility
or
that
it
makes
unavoidably
necessary
an
entirely
new
organization
of
society
in
which
production
is
no
longer
directed
by
mutually
competing
individual
industrialists
but
rather
by
the
whole
society
operating
according
to
a
definite
plan
and
taking
account
of
the
needs
of
all
second
that
big
industry
and
the
limitless
expansion
of
production
which
it
makes
possible
bring
within
the
range
of
feasibility
a
social
order
in
which
so
much
is
produced
that
every
member
of
society
will
be
in
a
position
to
exercise
and
develop
all
his
powers
and
faculties
in
complete
freedom
it
thus
appears
that
the
very
qualities
of
big
industry
which
in
our
present
day
society
produce
misery
and
crises
are
those
which
in
a
different
form
of
society
will
abolish
this
misery
and
these
catastrophic
depressions
we
see
with
the
greatest
clarity
i
that
all
these
evils
are
from
now
on
to
be
ascribed
solely
to
a
social
order
which
no
longer
corresponds
to
the
requirements
of
the
real
situation
and
ii
that
it
is
possible
through
a
new
social
order
to
do
away
with
these
evils
altogether
what
will
this
new
social
order
have
to
be
like
above
all
it
will
have
to
take
the
control
of
industry
and
of
all
branches
of
production
out
of
the
hands
of
mutually
competing
individuals
and
instead
institute
a
system
in
which
all
these
branches
of
production
are
operated
by
society
as
a
whole
that
is
for
the
common
account
according
to
a
common
plan
and
with
the
participation
of
all
members
of
society
it
will
in
other
words
abolish
competition
and
replace
it
with
association
moreover
since
the
management
of
industry
by
individuals
necessarily
implies
private
property
and
since
competition
is
in
reality
merely
the
manner
and
form
in
which
the
control
of
industry
by
private
property
owners
expresses
itself
it
follows
that
private
property
cannot
be
separated
from
competition
and
the
individual
management
of
industry
private
property
must
therefore
be
abolished
and
in
its
place
must
come
the
common
utilization
of
all
instruments
of
production
and
the
distribution
of
all
products
according
to
common
agreement
in
a
word
what
is
called
the
communal
ownership
of
goods
in
fact
the
abolition
of
private
property
is
doubtless
the
shortest
and
most
significant
way
to
characterize
the
revolution
in
the
whole
social
order
which
has
been
made
necessary
by
the
development
of
industry
and
for
this
reason
it
is
rightly
advanced
by
communists
as
their
main
demand
draft
of
a
communist
confession
of
faith
was
not
the
abolition
of
private
property
possible
at
an
earlier
time
no
every
change
in
the
social
order
every
revolution
in
property
relations
is
the
necessary
consequence
of
the
creation
of
new
forces
of
production
which
no
longer
fit
into
the
old
property
relations
private
property
has
not
always
existed
when
towards
the
end
of
the
middle
ages
there
arose
a
new
mode
of
production
which
could
not
be
carried
on
under
the
then
existing
feudal
and
guild
forms
of
property
this
manufacture
which
had
outgrown
the
old
property
relations
created
a
new
property
form
private
property
and
for
manufacture
and
the
earliest
stage
of
development
of
big
industry
private
property
was
the
only
possible
property
form
the
social
order
based
on
it
was
the
only
possible
social
order
so
long
as
it
is
not
possible
to
produce
so
much
that
there
is
enough
for
all
with
more
left
over
for
expanding
the
social
capital
and
extending
the
forces
of
production
so
long
as
this
is
not
possible
there
must
always
be
a
ruling
class
directing
the
use
of
society
s
productive
forces
and
a
poor
oppressed
class
how
these
classes
are
constituted
depends
on
the
stage
of
development
the
agrarian
middle
ages
give
us
the
baron
and
the
serf
the
cities
of
the
later
middle
ages
show
us
the
guildmaster
and
the
journeyman
and
the
day
laborer
the
th
century
has
its
manufacturing
workers
the
th
has
big
factory
owners
and
proletarians
it
is
clear
that
up
to
now
the
forces
of
production
have
never
been
developed
to
the
point
where
enough
could
be
developed
for
all
and
that
private
property
has
become
a
fetter
and
a
barrier
in
relation
to
the
further
development
of
the
forces
of
production
now
however
the
development
of
big
industry
has
ushered
in
a
new
period
capital
and
the
forces
of
production
have
been
expanded
to
an
unprecedented
extent
and
the
means
are
at
hand
to
multiply
them
without
limit
in
the
near
future
moreover
the
forces
of
production
have
been
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
a
few
bourgeois
while
the
great
mass
of
the
people
are
more
and
more
falling
into
the
proletariat
their
situation
becoming
more
wretched
and
intolerable
in
proportion
to
the
increase
of
wealth
of
the
bourgeoisie
and
finally
these
mighty
and
easily
extended
forces
of
production
have
so
far
outgrown
private
property
and
the
bourgeoisie
that
they
threaten
at
any
moment
to
unleash
the
most
violent
disturbances
of
the
social
order
now
under
these
conditions
the
abolition
of
private
property
has
become
not
only
possible
but
absolutely
necessary
will
the
peaceful
abolition
of
private
property
be
possible
it
would
be
desirable
if
this
could
happen
and
the
communists
would
certainly
be
the
last
to
oppose
it
communists
know
only
too
well
that
all
conspiracies
are
not
only
useless
but
even
harmful
they
know
all
too
well
that
revolutions
are
not
made
intentionally
and
arbitrarily
but
that
everywhere
and
always
they
have
been
the
necessary
consequence
of
conditions
which
were
wholly
independent
of
the
will
and
direction
of
individual
parties
and
entire
classes
but
they
also
see
that
the
development
of
the
proletariat
in
nearly
all
civilized
countries
has
been
violently
suppressed
and
that
in
this
way
the
opponents
of
communism
have
been
working
toward
a
revolution
with
all
their
strength
if
the
oppressed
proletariat
is
finally
driven
to
revolution
then
we
communists
will
defend
the
interests
of
the
proletarians
with
deeds
as
we
now
defend
them
with
words
draft
of
a
communist
confession
of
faith
will
it
be
possible
for
private
property
to
be
abolished
at
one
stroke
no
no
more
than
existing
forces
of
production
can
at
one
stroke
be
multiplied
to
the
extent
necessary
for
the
creation
of
a
communal
society
in
all
probability
the
proletarian
revolution
will
transform
existing
society
gradually
and
will
be
able
to
abolish
private
property
only
when
the
means
of
production
are
available
in
sufficient
quantity
what
will
be
the
course
of
this
revolution
above
all
it
will
establish
a
democratic
constitution
and
through
this
the
direct
or
indirect
dominance
of
the
proletariat
direct
in
england
where
the
proletarians
are
already
a
majority
of
the
people
indirect
in
france
and
germany
where
the
majority
of
the
people
consists
not
only
of
proletarians
but
also
of
small
peasants
and
petty
bourgeois
who
are
in
the
process
of
falling
into
the
proletariat
who
are
more
and
more
dependent
in
all
their
political
interests
on
the
proletariat
and
who
must
therefore
soon
adapt
to
the
demands
of
the
proletariat
perhaps
this
will
cost
a
second
struggle
but
the
outcome
can
only
be
the
victory
of
the
proletariat
democracy
would
be
wholly
valueless
to
the
proletariat
if
it
were
not
immediately
used
as
a
means
for
putting
through
measures
directed
against
private
property
and
ensuring
the
livelihood
of
the
proletariat
the
main
measures
emerging
as
the
necessary
result
of

relations
are
the
following
i

all
capital
all
agriculture
all
transport
all
trade
all
the
foregoing
measures
are
directed
to
this
end
and
they
will
become
practicable
and
feasible
capable
of
producing
their
centralizing
effects
to
precisely
the
degree
that
the
proletariat
through
its
labor
multiplies
the
country
s
productive
forces
finally
when
all
capital
all
production
all
exchange
have
been
brought
together
in
the
hands
of
the
nation
private
property
will
disappear
of
its
own
accord
money
will
become
superfluous
and
production
will
so
expand
and
man
so
change
that
society
will
be
able
to
slough
off
whatever
of
its
old
economic
habits
may
remain
will
it
be
possible
for
this
revolution
to
take
place
in
one
country
alone
no
by
creating
the
world
market
big
industry
has
already
brought
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
and
especially
the
civilized
peoples
into
such
close
relation
with
one
another
that
none
is
independent
of
what
happens
to
the
others
further
it
has
co
ordinated
the
social
development
of
the
civilized
countries
to
such
an
extent
that
in
all
of
them
bourgeoisie
and
proletariat
have
become
the
decisive
classes
and
the
struggle
between
them
the
great
struggle
of
the
day
it
follows
that
the
communist
revolution
will
not
merely
be
a
national
phenomenon
but
must
take
place
simultaneously
in
all
civilized
countries
that
is
to
say
at
least
in
england
america
france
and
germany
it
will
develop
in
each
of
the
these
countries
more
or
less
rapidly
according
as
one
country
or
the
other
has
a
more
developed
industry
greater
wealth
a
more
significant
mass
of
productive
forces
hence
it
will
go
slowest
and
will
meet
most
obstacles
in
germany
most
rapidly
and
with
the
fewest
difficulties
in
england
it
will
have
a
powerful
impact
on
the
other
countries
of
the
world
and
will
radically
alter
the
course
of
development
which
they
have
followed
up
to
now
while
greatly
stepping
up
its
pace
it
is
a
universal
revolution
and
will
accordingly
have
a
universal
range
what
will
be
the
consequences
of
the
ultimate
disappearance
of
private
property
society
will
take
all
forces
of
production
and
means
of
commerce
as
well
as
the
exchange
and
distribution
of
products
out
of
the
hands
of
private
capitalists
and
will
manage
them
in
accordance
with
a
plan
based
on
the
availability
of
resources
and
the
needs
of
the
whole
society
in
this
way
most
important
of
all
the
evil
consequences
which
are
now
associated
with
the
conduct
of
big
industry
will
be
abolished
there
will
be
no
more
crises
the
expanded
production
which
for
the
present
order
of
society
is
overproduction
and
hence
a
prevailing
cause
of
misery
will
then
be
insufficient
and
in
need
of
draft
of
a
communist
confession
of
faith
being
expanded
much
further
instead
of
generating
misery
overproduction
will
reach
beyond
the
elementary
requirements
of
society
to
assure
the
satisfaction
of
the
needs
of
all
it
will
create
new
needs
and
at
the
same
time
the
means
of
satisfying
them
it
will
become
the
condition
of
and
the
stimulus
to
new
progress
which
will
no
longer
throw
the
whole
social
order
into
confusion
as
progress
has
always
done
in
the
past
big
industry
freed
from
the
pressure
of
private
property
will
undergo
such
an
expansion
that
what
we
now
see
will
seem
as
petty
in
comparison
as
manufacture
seems
when
put
beside
the
big
industry
of
our
own
day
this
development
of
industry
will
make
available
to
society
a
sufficient
mass
of
products
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
everyone
the
same
will
be
true
of
agriculture
which
also
suffers
from
the
pressure
of
private
property
and
is
held
back
by
the
division
of
privately
owned
land
into
small
parcels
here
existing
improvements
and
scientific
procedures
will
be
put
into
practice
with
a
resulting
leap
forward
which
will
assure
to
society
all
the
products
it
needs
in
this
way
such
an
abundance
of
goods
will
be
able
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
all
its
members
the
division
of
society
into
different
mutually
hostile
classes
will
then
become
unnecessary
indeed
it
will
be
not
only
unnecessary
but
intolerable
in
the
new
social
order
the
existence
of
classes
originated
in
the
division
of
labor
and
the
division
of
labor
as
it
has
been
known
up
to
the
present
will
completely
disappear
for
mechanical
and
chemical
processes
are
not
enough
to
bring
industrial
and
agricultural
production
up
to
the
level
we
have
described
the
capacities
of
the
men
who
make
use
of
these
processes
must
undergo
a
corresponding
development
just
as
the
peasants
and
manufacturing
workers
of
the
last
century
changed
their
whole
way
of
life
and
became
quite
different
people
when
they
were
drawn
into
big
industry
in
the
same
way
communal
control
over
production
by
society
as
a
whole
and
the
resulting
new
development
will
both
require
an
entirely
different
kind
of
human
material
people
will
no
longer
be
as
they
are
today
subordinated
to
a
single
branch
of
production
bound
to
it
exploited
by
it
they
will
no
longer
develop
one
of
their
faculties
at
the
expense
of
all
others
they
will
no
longer
know
only
one
branch
or
one
branch
of
a
single
branch
of
production
as
a
whole
even
industry
as
it
is
today
is
finding
such
people
less
and
less
useful
industry
controlled
by
society
as
a
whole
and
operated
according
to
a
plan
presupposes
wellrounded
human
beings
their
faculties
developed
in
balanced
fashion
able
to
see
the
system
of
production
in
its
entirety
the
form
of
the
division
of
labor
which
makes
one
a
peasant
another
a
cobbler
a
third
a
factory
worker
a
fourth
a
stock
market
operator
has
already
been
undermined
by
machinery
and
will
completely
disappear
education
will
enable
young
people
quickly
to
familiarize
themselves
with
the
whole
system
of
production
and
to
pass
from
one
branch
of
production
to
another
in
response
to
the
needs
of
society
or
their
own
inclinations
it
will
therefore
free
them
from
the
one
sided
character
which
the
present
day
division
of
labor
impresses
upon
every
individual
communist
society
will
in
this
way
make
it
possible
for
its
members
to
put
their
comprehensively
developed
faculties
to
full
use
but
when
this
happens
classes
will
necessarily
disappear
it
follows
that
society
organized
on
a
communist
basis
is
incompatible
with
the
existence
of
classes
on
the
one
hand
and
that
the
very
building
of
such
a
society
provides
the
means
of
abolishing
class
differences
on
the
other
a
corollary
of
this
is
that
the
difference
between
city
and
country
is
destined
to
disappear
the
management
of
agriculture
and
industry
by
the
same
people
rather
than
by
two
different
classes
of
people
is
if
only
for
purely
material
reasons
a
necessary
condition
of
communist
association
the
dispersal
of
the
agricultural
population
on
the
land
alongside
the
crowding
of
the
industrial
population
into
the
great
cities
is
a
condition
which
corresponds
to
an
undeveloped
state
of
both
agriculture
and
industry
and
can
already
be
felt
as
an
obstacle
to
further
development
draft
of
a
communist
confession
of
faith
the
general
co
operation
of
all
members
of
society
for
the
purpose
of
planned
exploitation
of
the
forces
of
production
the
expansion
of
production
to
the
point
where
it
will
satisfy
the
needs
of
all
the
abolition
of
a
situation
in
which
the
needs
of
some
are
satisfied
at
the
expense
of
the
needs
of
others
the
complete
liquidation
of
classes
and
their
conflicts
the
rounded
development
of
the
capacities
of
all
members
of
society
through
the
elimination
of
the
present
division
of
labor
through
industrial
education
through
engaging
in
varying
activities
through
the
participation
by
all
in
the
enjoyments
produced
by
all
through
the
combination
of
city
and
country
these
are
the
main
consequences
of
the
abolition
of
private
property
what
will
be
the
influence
of
communist
society
on
the
family
it
will
transform
the
relations
between
the
sexes
into
a
purely
private
matter
which
concerns
only
the
persons
involved
and
into
which
society
has
no
occasion
to
intervene
it
can
do
this
since
it
does
away
with
private
property
and
educates
children
on
a
communal
basis
and
in
this
way
removes
the
two
bases
of
traditional
marriage
the
dependence
rooted
in
private
property
of
the
women
on
the
man
and
of
the
children
on
the
parents
and
here
is
the
answer
to
the
outcry
of
the
highly
moral
philistines
against
the
community
of
women
community
of
women
is
a
condition
which
belongs
entirely
to
bourgeois
society
and
which
today
finds
its
complete
expression
in
prostitution
but
prostitution
is
based
on
private
property
and
falls
with
it
thus
communist
society
instead
of
introducing
community
of
women
in
fact
abolishes
it
what
will
be
the
attitude
of
communism
to
existing
nationalities
the
nationalities
of
the
peoples
associating
themselves
in
accordance
with
the
principle
of
community
will
be
compelled
to
mingle
with
each
other
as
a
result
of
this
association
and
thereby
to
dissolve
themselves
just
as
the
various
estate
and
class
distinctions
must
disappear
through
the
abolition
of
their
basis
private
property
what
will
be
its
attitude
to
existing
religions
all
religions
so
far
have
been
the
expression
of
historical
stages
of
development
of
individual
peoples
or
groups
of
peoples
but
communism
is
the
stage
of
historical
development
which
makes
all
existing
religions
superfluous
and
brings
about
their
disappearance
how
do
communists
differ
from
socialists
the
so
called
socialists
are
divided
into
three
categories
reactionary
socialists
the
first
category
consists
of
adherents
of
a
feudal
and
patriarchal
society
which
has
already
been
destroyed
and
is
still
daily
being
destroyed
by
big
industry
and
world
trade
and
their
creation
bourgeois
society
this
category
concludes
from
the
evils
of
existing
society
that
feudal
and
patriarchal
society
must
be
restored
because
it
was
free
of
such
evils
in
one
way
or
another
all
their
proposals
are
directed
to
this
end
draft
of
a
communist
confession
of
faith
this
category
of
reactionary
socialists
for
all
their
seeming
partisanship
and
their
scalding
tears
for
the
misery
of
the
proletariat
is
nevertheless
energetically
opposed
by
the
communists
for
the
following
reasons
i
it
strives
for
something
which
is
entirely
impossible
ii
it
seeks
to
establish
the
rule
of
the
aristocracy
the
guildmasters
the
small
producers
and
their
retinue
of
absolute
or
feudal
monarchs
officials
soldiers
and
priests
a
society
which
was
to
be
sure
free
of
the
evils
of
present
day
society
but
which
brought
it
at
least
as
many
evils
without
even
offering
to
the
oppressed
workers
the
prospect
of
liberation
through
a
communist
revolution
iii
as
soon
as
the
proletariat
becomes
revolutionary
and
communist
these
reactionary
socialists
show
their
true
colors
by
immediately
making
common
cause
with
the
bourgeoisie
against
the
proletarians
bourgeois
socialists
the
second
category
consists
of
adherents
of
present
day
society
who
have
been
frightened
for
its
future
by
the
evils
to
which
it
necessarily
gives
rise
what
they
want
therefore
is
to
maintain
this
society
while
getting
rid
of
the
evils
which
are
an
inherent
part
of
it
to
this
end
some
propose
mere
welfare
measures
while
others
come
forward
with
grandiose
systems
of
reform
which
under
the
pretense
of
re
organizing
society
are
in
fact
intended
to
preserve
the
foundations
and
hence
the
life
of
existing
society
communists
must
unremittingly
struggle
against
these
bourgeois
socialists
because
they
work
for
the
enemies
of
communists
and
protect
the
society
which
communists
aim
to
overthrow
democratic
socialists
finally
the
third
category
consists
of
democratic
socialists
who
favor
some
of
the
same
measures
the
communists
advocate
as
described
in
question
not
as
part
of
the
transition
to
communism
however
but
as
measures
which
they
believe
will
be
sufficient
to
abolish
the
misery
and
evils
of
present
day
society
these
democratic
socialists
are
either
proletarians
who
are
not
yet
sufficiently
clear
about
the
conditions
of
the
liberation
of
their
class
or
they
are
representatives
of
the
petty
bourgeoisie
a
class
which
prior
to
the
achievement
of
democracy
and
the
socialist
measures
to
which
it
gives
rise
has
many
interests
in
common
with
the
proletariat
it
follows
that
in
moments
of
action
the
communists
will
have
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
these
democratic
socialists
and
in
general
to
follow
as
far
as
possible
a
common
policy
with
them
provided
that
these
socialists
do
not
enter
into
the
service
of
the
ruling
bourgeoisie
and
attack
the
communists
it
is
clear
that
this
form
of
co
operation
in
action
does
not
exclude
the
discussion
of
differences
what
is
the
attitude
of
the
communists
to
the
other
political
parties
of
our
time
this
attitude
is
different
in
the
different
countries
in
england
france
and
belgium
where
the
bourgeoisie
rules
the
communists
still
have
a
common
interest
with
the
various
democratic
parties
an
interest
which
is
all
the
greater
the
more
closely
the
socialistic
measures
they
champion
approach
the
aims
of
the
communists
that
is
the
more
clearly
and
definitely
they
represent
the
interests
of
the
proletariat
and
the
more
they
depend
on
the
proletariat
for
support
in
england
for
example
the
working
class
chartists
are
infinitely
closer
to
the
communists
than
the
democratic
petty
bourgeoisie
or
the
so
called
radicals
draft
of
a
communist
confession
of
faith
in
america
where
a
democratic
constitution
has
already
been
established
the
communists
must
make
the
common
cause
with
the
party
which
will
turn
this
constitution
against
the
bourgeoisie
and
use
it
in
the
interests
of
the
proletariat
that
is
with
the
agrarian
national
reformers
in
switzerland
the
radicals
though
a
very
mixed
party
are
the
only
group
with
which
the
communists
can
co
operate
and
among
these
radicals
the
vaudois
and
genevese
are
the
most
advanced
in
germany
finally
the
decisive
struggle
now
on
the
order
of
the
day
is
that
between
the
bourgeoisie
and
the
absolute
monarchy
since
the
communists
cannot
enter
upon
the
decisive
struggle
between
themselves
and
the
bourgeoisie
until
the
bourgeoisie
is
in
power
it
follows
that
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
communists
to
help
the
bourgeoisie
to
power
as
soon
as
possible
in
order
the
sooner
to
be
able
to
overthrow
it
against
the
governments
therefore
the
communists
must
continually
support
the
radical
liberal
party
taking
care
to
avoid
the
self
deceptions
of
the
bourgeoisie
and
not
fall
for
the
enticing
promises
of
benefits
which
a
victory
for
the
bourgeoisie
would
allegedly
bring
to
the
proletariat
the
sole
advantages
which
the
proletariat
would
derive
from
a
bourgeois
victory
would
consist
i
in
various
concessions
which
would
facilitate
the
unification
of
the
proletariat
into
a
closely
knit
battle
worthy
and
organized
class
and
ii
in
the
certainly
that
on
the
very
day
the
absolute
monarchies
fall
the
struggle
between
bourgeoisie
and
proletariat
will
start
from
that
day
on
the
policy
of
the
communists
will
be
the
same
as
it
now
is
in
the
countries
where
the
bourgeoisie
is
already
in
power
demands
of
the
communist
party
in
germany
demands
of
the
communist
party
in
germany
were
written
by
karl
marx
and
frederick
engels
in
paris
between
march
when
engels
arrived
in
paris
from
brussels
and
march
this
document
was
discussed
by
members
of
the
central
authority
who
approved
and
signed
it
as
the
political
programme
of
the
communist
league
in
the
revolution
that
broke
out
in
germany
in
march
it
was
printed
as
a
leaflet
for
distribution
among
revolutionary
german
emigrant
workers
who
were
about
to
return
home
austrian
and
german
diplomats
in
paris
informed
their
respective
governments
about
this
as
early
as
march
and
the
austrian
ambassador
enclosed
in
his
letter
a
copy
of
the
leaflet
which
he
dated
march
the

soon
reached

taking
into

duty
and
their
absolute
right
to
render
themselves
masters
of
their

seizing
upon

the
gigantic

police
the
physical
force
elements
of
the
old
government
the
commune
was
anxious
to
break
the
spiritual
force
of
repression
the
parsonpower
by
the
disestablishment
and
disendowment
of
all
churches
as
proprietary
bodies
the
priests
were
sent
back
to
the
recesses
of
private
life
there
to
feed
upon
the
alms
of
the
faithful
in
imitation
of
their
predecessors
the
apostles
the
whole
of
the
educational
institutions
were
opened
to
the
people
gratuitously
and
at
the
same
time
cleared
of
all
interference
of
church
and
state
thus
not
only
was
education
made
accessible
to
all
but
science
itself
freed
from
the
fetters
which
class
prejudice
and
governmental
force
had
imposed
upon
it
the
judicial
functionaries
were
to
be
divested
of
that
sham
independence
which
had
but
served
to
mask
their
abject
subserviency
to
all
succeeding
governments
to
which
in
turn
they
had
taken
and
broken
the
oaths
of
allegiance
like
the
rest
of
public
servants
magistrates
and
judges
were
to
be
elective
responsible
and
revocable
the
paris
commune
was
of
course
to
serve
as
a
model
to
all
the
great
industrial
centres
of
france
the
communal
regime
once
established
in
paris
and
the
secondary
centres
the
old
centralized
government
would
in
the
provinces
too
have
to
give
way
to
the
self
government
of
the
producers
in
a
rough
sketch
of
national
organisation
which
the
commune
had
no
time
to
develop
it
states
clearly
that
the
commune
was
to
be
the
political
form
of
even
the
smallest
country
hamlet
and
that
in
the
rural
districts
the
standing
army
was
to
be
replaced
by
a
national
militia
with
an
extremely
short
term
of
service
the
rural
communities
of
every
district
were
to
administer
their
common
affairs
by
an
assembly
of
delegates
in
the
central
town
and
these
district
assemblies
were
again
to
send
deputies
to
the
national
delegation
in
paris
each
delegate
to
be
at
any
time
revocable
and
bound
by
the
mandat
imperatif
formal
instructions
of
his
constituents
the
few
but
important
functions
which
would
still
remain
for
a
central
government
were
not
to
be
suppressed
as
has
been
intentionally
misstated
but
were
to
be
discharged
by
communal
and
thereafter
responsible
agents
the
unity
of
the
nation
was
not
to
be
broken
but
on
the
contrary
to
be
organized
by
communal
constitution
and
to
become
a
reality
by
the
destruction
of
the
state
power
which
claimed
to
be
third
address
to
the
international
working
men
s
association
may
the
embodiment
of
that
unity
independent
of
and
superior
to
the
nation
itself
from
which
it
was
but
a
parasitic
excrescence
while
the
merely
repressive
organs
of
the
old
governmental
power
were
to
be
amputated
its
legitimate
functions
were
to
be
wrested
from
an
authority
usurping
pre
eminence
over
society
itself
and
restored
to
the
responsible
agents
of
society
instead
of
deciding
once
in
three
or
six
years
which
member
of
the
ruling
class
was
to
misrepresent
the
people
in
parliament
universal
suffrage
was
to
serve
the
people
constituted
in
communes
as
individual
suffrage
serves
every
other
employer
in
the
search
for
the
workmen
and
managers
in
his
business
and
it
is
well
known
that
companies
like
individuals
in
matters
of
real
business
generally
know
how
to
put
the
right
man
in
the
right
place
and
if
they
for
once
make
a
mistake
to
redress
it
promptly
on
the
other
hand
nothing
could
be
more
foreign
to
the
spirit
of
the
commune
than
to
supercede
universal
suffrage
by
hierarchical
investiture
it
is
generally
the
fate
of
completely
new
historical
creations
to
be
mistaken
for
the
counterparts
of
older
and
even
defunct
forms
of
social
life
to
which
they
may
bear
a
certain
likeness
thus
this
new
commune
which
breaks
with
the
modern
state
power
has
been
mistaken
for
a
reproduction
of
the
medieval
communes
which
first
preceded
and
afterward
became
the
substratum
of
that
very
state
power
the
communal
constitution
has
been
mistaken
for
an
attempt
to
break
up
into
the
federation
of
small
states
as
dreamt
of
by
montesquieu
and
the
girondins
that
unity
of
great
nations
which
if
originally
brought
about
by
political
force
has
now
become
a
powerful
coefficient
of
social
production
the
antagonism
of
the
commune
against
the
state
power
has
been
mistaken
for
an
exaggerated
form
of
the
ancient
struggle
against
over
centralization
peculiar
historical
circumstances
may
have
prevented
the
classical
development
as
in
france
of
the
bourgeois
form
of
government
and
may
have
allowed
as
in
england
to
complete
the
great
central
state
organs
by
corrupt
vestries
jobbing
councillors
and
ferocious
poor
law
guardians
in
the
towns
and
virtually
hereditary
magistrates
in
the
counties
the
communal
constitution
would
have
restored
to
the
social
body
all
the
forces
hitherto
absorbed
by
the
state
parasite
feeding
upon
and
clogging
the
free
movement
of
society
by
this
one
act
it
would
have
initiated
the
regeneration
of
france
the
provincial
french
bourgeois
saw
in
the
commune
an
attempt
to
restore
the
sway
their
order
had
held
over
the
country
under
louis
philippe
and
which
under
louis
napoleon
was
supplanted
by
the
pretended
rule
of
the
country
over
the
towns
in
reality
the
communal
constitution
brought
the
rural
producers
under
the
intellectual
lead
of
the
central
towns
of
their
districts
and
there
secured
to
them
in
the
working
men
the
natural
trustees
of
their
interests
the
very
existence
of
the
commune
involved
as
a
matter
of
course
local
municipal
liberty
but
no
longer
as
a
check
upon
the
now
superseded
state
power
it
could
only
enter
into
the
head
of
a
bismarck
who
when
not
engaged
on
his
intrigues
of
blood
and
iron
always
likes
to
resume
his
old
trade
so
befitting
his
mental
calibre
of
contributor
to
kladderadatsch
the
berlin
punch
it
could
only
enter
into
such
a
head
to
ascribe
to
the
paris
commune
aspirations
after
the
caricature
of
the
old
french
municipal
organization
of
the
prussian
municipal
constitution
which
degrades
the
town
governments
to
mere
secondary
wheels
in
the
police
machinery
of
the
prussian
state
the
commune
made
that
catchword
of
bourgeois
revolutions
cheap
government
a
reality
by
destroying
the
two
greatest
sources
of
expenditure
the
standing
army
and
state
functionarism
its
very
existence
presupposed
the
non
existence
of
monarchy
which
in
europe
at
least
is
the
normal
encumbrance
and
indispensable
cloak
of
class
rule
it
supplied
the
republic
with
the
basis
of
really
democratic
institutions
but
neither
cheap
government
nor
the
true
republic
was
its
ultimate
aim
they
were
its
mere
concomitants
the
multiplicity
of
interpretations
to
which
the
commune
has
been
subjected
and
the
multiplicity
of
interests
which
construed
it
in
their
favor
show
that
it
was
a
thoroughly
expansive
political
form
while
all
the
previous
forms
of
government
had
been
emphatically
repressive
its
true
secret
was
this
it
was
essentially
a
working
class
government
the
product
of
the
struggle
of
the
third
address
to
the
international
working
men
s
association
may
producing
against
the
appropriating
class
the
political
form
at
last
discovered
under
which
to
work
out
the
economical
emancipation
of
labor
except
on
this
last
condition
the
communal
constitution
would
have
been
an
impossibility
and
a
delusion
the
political
rule
of
the
producer
cannot
co
exist
with
the
perpetuation
of
his
social
slavery
the
commune
was
therefore
to
serve
as
a
lever
for
uprooting
the
economical
foundation
upon
which
rests
the
existence
of
classes
and
therefore
of
class
rule
with
labor
emancipated
every
man
becomes
a
working
man
and
productive
labor
ceases
to
be
a
class
attribute
it
is
a
strange
fact
in
spite
of
all
the
tall
talk
and
all
the
immense
literature
for
the
last
years
about
emancipation
of
labor
no
sooner
do
the
working
men
anywhere
take
the
subject
into
their
own
hands
with
a
will
than
uprises
at
once
all
the
apologetic
phraseology
of
the
mouthpieces
of
present
society
with
its
two
poles
of
capital
and
wage
slavery
the
landlord
now
is
but
the
sleeping
partner
of
the
capitalist
as
if
the
capitalist
society
was
still
in
its
purest
state
of
virgin
innocence
with
its
antagonisms
still
undeveloped
with
its
delusions
still
unexploded
with
its
prostitute
realities
not
yet
laid
bare
the
commune
they
exclaim
intends
to
abolish
property
the
basis
of
all
civilization
yes
gentlemen
the
commune
intended
to
abolish
that
class
property
which
makes
the
labor
of
the
many
the
wealth
of
the
few
it
aimed
at
the
expropriation
of
the
expropriators
it
wanted
to
make
individual
property
a
truth
by
transforming
the
means
of
production
land
and
capital
now
chiefly
the
means
of
enslaving
and
exploiting
labor
into
mere
instruments
of
free
and
associated
labor
but
this
is
communism
impossible
communism
why
those
member
of
the
ruling
classes
who
are
intelligent
enough
to
perceive
the
impossibility
of
continuing
the
present
system
and
they
are
many
have
become
the
obtrusive
and
full
mouthed
apostles
of
co
operative
production
if
co
operative
production
is
not
to
remain
a
sham
and
a
snare
if
it
is
to
supersede
the
capitalist
system
if
united
co
operative
societies
are
to
regulate
national
production
upon
common
plan
thus
taking
it
under
their
own
control
and
putting
an
end
to
the
constant
anarchy
and
periodical
convulsions
which
are
the
fatality
of
capitalist
production
what
else
gentlemen
would
it
be
but
communism
possible
communism
the
working
class
did
not
expect
miracles
from
the
commune
they
have
no
ready
made
utopias
to
introduce
par
decret
du
peuple
they
know
that
in
order
to
work
out
their
own
emancipation
and
along
with
it
that
higher
form
to
which
present
society
is
irresistibly
tending
by
its
own
economical
agencies
they
will
have
to
pass
through
long
struggles
through
a
series
of
historic
processes
transforming
circumstances
and
men
they
have
no
ideals
to
realize
but
to
set
free
the
elements
of
the
new
society
with
which
old
collapsing
bourgeois
society
itself
is
pregnant
in
the
full
consciousness
of
their
historic
mission
and
with
the
heroic
resolve
to
act
up
to
it
the
working
class
can
afford
to
smile
at
the
coarse
invective
of
the
gentlemen
s
gentlemen
with
pen
and
inkhorn
and
at
the
didactic
patronage
of
well
wishing
bourgeois
doctrinaires
pouring
forth
their
ignorant
platitudes
and
sectarian
crotchets
in
the
oracular
tone
of
scientific
infallibility
when
the
paris
commune
took
the
management
of
the
revolution
in
its
own
hands
when
plain
working
men
for
the
first
time
dared
to
infringe
upon
the
governmental
privilege
of
their
natural
superiors
and
under
circumstances
of
unexampled
difficulty
performed
it
at
salaries
the
highest
of
which
barely
amounted
to
one
fifth
what
according
to
high
scientific
authority
is
the
minimum
required
for
a
secretary
to
a
certain
metropolitan
school
board
the
old
world
writhed
in
convulsions
of
rage
at
the
sight
of
the
red
flag
the
symbol
of
the
republic
of
labor
floating
over
the
h
tel
de
ville
and
yet
this
was
the
first
revolution
in
which
the
working
class
was
openly
acknowledged
as
the
only
class
capable
of
social
initiative
even
by
the
great
bulk
of
the
paris
bourgeois
shopkeepers
tradesmen
merchants
the
wealthy
capitalist
alone
excepted
the
commune
had
professor
huxley
note
to
the
german
addition
of
third
address
to
the
international
working
men
s
association
may
saved
them
by
a
sagacious
settlement
of
that
ever
recurring
cause
of
dispute
among
the
bourgeois
themselves
the
debtor
and
creditor
accounts
the
same
portion
of
the
bourgeois
after
they
had
assisted
in
putting
down
the
working
men
s
insurrection
of
june
had
been
at
once
unceremoniously
sacrificed
to
their
creditors
by
the
then
constituent
assembly
but
this
was
not
their
only
motive
for
now
rallying
around
the
working
class
they
felt
there
was
but
one
alternative
the
commune
or
the
empire
under
whatever
name
it
might
reappear
the
empire
had
ruined
them
economically
by
the
havoc
it
made
of
public
wealth
by
the
wholesale
financial
swindling
it
fostered
by
the
props
it
lent
to
the
artificially
accelerated
centralization
of
capital
and
the
concomitant
expropriation
of
their
own
ranks
it
had
suppressed
them
politically
it
had
shocked
them
morally
by
its
orgies
it
had
insulted
their
voltairianism
by
handing
over
the
education
of
their
children
to
the
fr
res
ignorantins
it
had
revolted
their
national
feeling
as
frenchmen
by
precipitating
them
headlong
into
a
war
which
left
only
one
equivalent
for
the
ruins
it
made
the
disappearance
of
the
empire
in
fact
after
the
exodus
from
paris
of
the
high
bonapartist
and
capitalist
boheme
the
true
bourgeois
party
of
order
came
out
in
the
shape
of
the
union
republicaine
enrolling
themselves
under
the
colors
of
the
commune
and
defending
it
against
the
wilful
misconstructions
of
thiers
whether
the
gratitude
of
this
great
body
of
the
bourgeois
will
stand
the
present
severe
trial
time
must
show
the
commune
was
perfectly
right
in
telling
the
peasants
that
its
victory
was
their
only
hope
of
all
the
lies
hatched
at
versailles
and
re
echoed
by
the
glorious
european
penny
a
liner
one
of
the
most
tremendous
was
that
the
rurals
represented
the
french
peasantry
think
only
of
the
love
of
the
french
peasant
for
the
men
to
whom
after
he
had
to
pay
the
milliard
indemnity
in
the
eyes
of
the
french
peasant
the
very
existence
of
a
great
landed
proprietor
is
in
itself
an
encroachment
on
his
conquests
of
the
bourgeois
in
had
burdened
his
plot
of
land
with
the
additional
tax
of
cents
in
the
franc
but
then
he
did
so
in
the
name
of
the
revolution
while
now
he
had
fomented
a
civil
war
against
revolution
to
shift
on
to
the
peasant
s
shoulders
the
chief
load
of
the
milliards
of
indemnity
to
be
paid
to
the
prussian
the
commune
on
the
other
hand
in
one
of
its
first
proclamations
declared
that
the
true
originators
of
the
war
would
be
made
to
pay
its
cost
the
commune
would
have
delivered
the
peasant
of
the
blood
tax
would
have
given
him
a
cheap
government
transformed
his
present
blood
suckers
the
notary
advocate
executor
and
other
judicial
vampires
into
salaried
communal
agents
elected
by
and
responsible
to
himself
it
would
have
freed
him
of
the
tyranny
of
the
garde
champetre
the
gendarme
and
the
prefect
would
have
put
enlightenment
by
the
schoolmaster
in
the
place
of
stultification
by
the
priest
and
the
french
peasant
is
above
all
a
man
of
reckoning
he
would
find
it
extremely
reasonable
that
the
pay
of
the
priest
instead
of
being
extorted
by
the
taxgatherer
should
only
depend
upon
the
spontaneous
action
of
the
parishioners
religious
instinct
such
were
the
great
immediate
boons
which
the
rule
of
the
commune
and
that
rule
alone
held
out
to
the
french
peasantry
it
is
therefore
quite
superfluous
here
to
expatiate
upon
the
more
complicated
but
vital
problems
which
the
commune
alone
was
able
and
at
the
same
time
compelled
to
solve
in
favor
of
the
peasant
viz
the
hypothecary
debt
lying
like
an
incubus
upon
his
parcel
of
soil
the
prol
tariat
foncier
the
rural
proletariat
daily
growing
upon
it
and
his
expropriation
from
it
enforced
at
a
more
and
more
rapid
rate
by
the
very
development
of
modern
agriculture
and
the
competition
of
capitalist
farming
the
french
peasant
had
elected
louis
bonaparte
president
of
the
republic
but
the
party
of
order
created
the
empire
what
the
french
peasant
really
wants
he
commenced
to
show
in
and
by
opposing
his
maire
to
the
government
s
prefect
his
school
master
to
the
government
s
priest
and
himself
to
the
government
s
gendarme
all
the
laws
made
by
the
party
of
order
in
january
and
february
were
avowed
measures
of
repression
against
the
peasant
the
peasant
was
a
bonapartist
because
the
great
revolution
with
all
its
benefits
to
him
was
in
his
eyes
personified
in
napoleon
this
delusion
rapidly
breaking
down
under
the
second
empire
and
in
third
address
to
the
international
working
men
s
association
may
its
very
nature
hostile
to
the
rurals
this
prejudice
of
the
past
how
could
it
have
withstood
the
appeal
of
the
commune
to
the
living
interests
and
urgent
wants
of
the
peasantry
the
rurals
this
was
in
fact
their
chief
apprehension
knew
that
three
months
free
communication
of
communal
paris

blockade
around

so

to
stop
the
spread
of

cattle
pest
contagious
disease
if
the
commune
was
thus
the
true
representative
of
all
the
healthy
elements
of
french
society
and
therefore
the
truly
national
government
it
was
at
the
same
time
as
a
working
men
s
government
as
the
bold
champion
of
the
emancipation
of
labor
emphatically
international
within
sight
of
that
prussian
army
that
had
annexed
to
germany
two
french
provinces
the
commune
annexed
to
france
the
working
people
all
over
the
world
the
second
empire
had
been
the
jubilee
of
cosmopolitan
blackleggism
the
rakes
of
all
countries
rushing
in
at
its
call
for
a
share
in
its
orgies
and
in
the
plunder
of
the
french
people
even
at
this
moment
the
right
hand
of
thiers
is
ganessco
the
foul
wallachian
and
his
left
hand
is
markovsky
the
russian
spy
the
commune
admitted
all
foreigners
to
the
honor
of
dying
for
an
immortal
cause
between
the
foreign
war
lost
by
their
treason
and
the
civil
war
fomented
by
their
conspiracy
with
the
foreign
invader
the
bourgeoisie
had
found
the
time
to
display
their
patriotism
by
organizing
police
hunts
upon
the
germans
in
france
the
commune
made
a
german
working
man
leo
frankel
its
minister
of
labor
thiers
the
bourgeoisie
the
second
empire
had
continually
deluded
poland
by
loud
professions
of
sympathy
while
in
reality
betraying
her
to
and
doing
the
dirty
work
of
russia
the
commune
honoured
the
heroic
sons
of
poland
j
dabrowski
and
w
wr
blewski
by
placing
them
at
the
head
of
the
defenders
of
paris
and
to
broadly
mark
the
new
era
of
history
it
was
conscious
of
initiating
under
the
eyes
of
the
conquering
prussians
on
one
side
and
the
bonapartist
army
led
by
bonapartist
generals
on
the
other
the
commune
pulled
down
that
colossal
symbol
of
martial
glory
the
vend
me
column
the
great
social
measure
of
the
commune
was
its
own
working
existence
its
special
measures
could
but
betoken
the
tendency
of
a
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
such
were
the
abolition
of
the
nightwork
of
journeymen
bakers
the
prohibition
under
penalty
of
the
employers
practice
to
reduce
wages
by
levying
upon
their
workpeople
fines
under
manifold
pretexts
a
process
in
which
the
employer
combines
in
his
own
person
the
parts
of
legislator
judge
and
executor
and
filches
the
money
to
boot
another
measure
of
this
class
was
the
surrender
to
associations
of
workmen
under
reserve
of
compensation
of
all
closed
workshops
and
factories
no
matter
whether
the
respective
capitalists
had
absconded
or
preferred
to
strike
work
the
financial
measures
of
the
commune
remarkable
for
their
sagacity
and
moderation
could
only
be
such
as
were
compatible
with
the
state
of
a
besieged
town
considering
the
colossal
robberies
committed
upon
the
city
of
paris
by
the
great
financial
companies
and
contractors
under
the
protection
of
haussman
the
commune
would
have
had
an
incomparably
better
title
to
confiscate
their
property
than
louis
napoleon
had
against
the
orleans
family
the
hohenzollern
and
the
english
oligarchs
who
both
have
derived
a
good
deal
of
their
estates
from
church
plunders
were
of
course
greatly
shocked
at
the
commune
clearing
but
f
out
of
secularization
while
the
versailles
government
as
soon
as
it
had
recovered
some
spirit
and
strength
used
the
most
violent
means
against
the
commune
while
it
put
down
the
free
expression
of
opinion
all
over
france
even
to
the
forbidding
of
meetings
of
delegates
from
the
large
towns
while
it
subjected
versailles
and
the
rest
of
france
to
an
espionage
far
surpassing
that
of
the
second
empire
while
it
burned
by
its
gendarme
inquisitors
all
papers
printed
at
paris
and
sifted
all
correspondence
from
and
to
paris
while
in
the
national
assembly
the
most
timid
attempts
to
put
in
a
word
for
paris
were
howled
down
in
a
manner
unknown
even
to
the
chambre
introuvable
of
third

to
the
international
working
men
s
association
may
with
the
savage
warfare
of
versailles
outside
and
its
attempts
at
corruption
and
conspiracy
inside
paris
would
the
commune
not
have
shamefully
betrayed
its
trust
by
affecting
to
keep
all
the
decencies
and
appearances
of
liberalism
as
in
a
time
of
profound
peace
had
the
government
of
the
commune
been
akin
to
that
of
m
thiers
there
would
have
been
no
more
occasion
to
suppress
party
of
order
papers
at
paris
that
there
was
to
suppress
communal
papers
at
versailles
it
was
irritating
indeed
to
the
rurals
that
at
the
very
same
time
they
declared
the
return
to
the
church
to
be
the
only
means
of
salvation
for
france
the
infidel
commune
unearthed
the
peculiar
mysteries
of
the
picpus
nunnery
and
of
the
church
of
st
laurent
it
was
a
satire
upon
m
thiers
that
while
he
showered
grand
crosses
upon
the
bonapartist
generals
in
acknowledgment
of
their
mastery
in
losing
battles
singing
capitulations
and
turning
cigarettes
at
wilhelmsh
he
the
commune
dismissed
and
arrested
its
generals
whenever
they
were
suspected
of
neglecting
their
duties
the
expulsion
from
and
arrest
by
the
commune
of
one
of
its
members
blanchet
who
had
slipped
in
under
a
false
name
and
had
undergone
at
lyons
six
days
imprisonment
for
simple
bankruptcy
was
it
not
a
deliberate
insult
hurled
at
the
forger
jules
favre
then
still
the
foreign
minister
of
france
still
selling
france
to
bismarck
and
still
dictating
his
orders
to
that
paragon
government
of
belgium
but
indeed
the
commune
did
not
pretend
to
infallibility
the
invariable
attribute
of
all
governments
of
the
old
stamp
it
published
its
doings
and
sayings
it
initiated
the
public
into
all
its
shortcomings
in
every
revolution
there
intrude
at
the
side
of
its
true
agents
men
of
different
stamp
some
of
them
survivors
of
and
devotees
to
past
revolutions
without
insight
into
the
present
movement
but
preserving
popular
influence
by
their
known
honesty
and
courage
or
by
the
sheer
force
of
tradition
others
mere
brawlers
who
by
dint
of
repeating
year
after
year
the
same
set
of
stereotyped
declarations
against
the
government
of
the
day
have
sneaked
into
the
reputation
of
revolutionists
of
the
first
water
after
march
some
such
men
did
also
turn
up
and
in
some
cases
contrived
to
play
pre
eminent
parts
as
far
as
their
power
went
they
hampered
the
real
action
of
the
working
class
exactly
as
men
of
that
sort
have
hampered
the
full
development
of
every
previous
revolution
they
are
an
unavoidable
evil
with
time
they
are
shaken
off
but
time
was
not
allowed
to
the

wonderful
indeed
was
the
change
the
commune
had
wrought
in
paris
no
longer
any
trace
of
the
tawdry
paris
of
the
second
empire
no
longer
was
paris
the
rendezvous
of
british
landlords
irish
absentees
american
ex
slaveholders
and
shoddy
men
russian
ex
serfowners
and
wallachian
boyards
no
more
corpses
at
the
morgue
no
nocturnal
burglaries
scarcely
any
robberies
in
fact
for
the
first
time
since
the
days
of
february
the
streets
of
paris
were
safe
and
that
without
any
police
of
any
kind
we
said
a
member
of
the
commune
hear
no
longer
of
assassination
theft
and
personal
assault
it
seems
indeed
as
if
the
police
had
dragged
along
with
it
to
versailles
all
its
conservative
friends
the
cocottes
had
refound
the
scent
of
their
protectors
the
absconding
men
of
family
religion
and
above
all
of
property
in
their
stead
the
real
women
of
paris
showed
again
at
the
surface
heroic
noble
and
devoted
like
the
women
of
antiquity
working
thinking
fighting
bleeding

forgetful
in
its
incubation
of
a

he
tells
the

itself
that
it

the
most
freely

he
tells
his

that

ever

he
tells
the

that
the

was
a
myth
if
some

shots

but
of

trying

make

that

he
again
tells

that
the

of

does
not
bombard

but
only
cannonades

he
tells
the
archbishop
of
paris
that
the
pretended
executions

attributed
to
the
versailles

were
all
moonshine
he
tells
paris
that
he
was
only
anxious
to
free
it
from
the
hideous
tyrants
who
oppress
it
and
that
in
fact
the
paris
of
the

was
but
a
handful
of

the

of

was
not
